Public,220,Soccer heading: potential for brain injury and opportunities for its mitigation,FITBIR-STUDY0000220,"Other, specify","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in athletes is a major and increasingly recognized public health problem. The presumed pathologic basis of the injury is multifocal microstructural traumatic axonal injury (TAI), which can be detected in vivo using diffusion tensor MRI (DTI). These structural changes have both short-term and long-term cognitive consequences. Our preliminary studies show that amateur soccer players do head the ball frequently, up to > 5,000 per year, and those who head more than 1,000- 1,500 times per year are at increased risk for structural (TAI) and functional (poorer cognitive performance) changes. Heading exposes the brain to repeated low-level (""subconcussive"") trauma. It is known that multiple head injuries in close succession are associated with worse outcomes. Additional work is needed to define exposure-response relationships for soccer heading, the time course for the onset and recovery from these structural and functional effects and particularly vulnerable populations. Herein, we use 3 integrated study designs to determine the influence of heading on brain structure and function. In a cross-sectional study (Aim 1), we assess the relationship of heading over the previous year to structural (TAI) and functional (cognition and post-concussion symptoms (PCS)) measures in a large sample (n=400) of amateur soccer players. To assess causality, we propose a longitudinal study to investigate the incremental effects of heading on changes in TAI, cognition and PCS over 2 years of follow-up (Aim 2). To assess the short-term relationship between heading and day-to-day variability in cognitive function and PCS as well as the predictive value of intensive measurement, we will assess heading, cognition and PCS on a daily basis for 14 days every 3 months using a hand-held device in a substudy of 100 players. We will also assess a number of potential modifiers of the association between heading and brain structure and function (e.g., Apolipoprotein E4 genotype).

Public,226,Quantitative MRI and 1H MRS in Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000226,Natural History,"Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) also known as concussion is a major public health problem with close to 1.5 million cases a year that can result in long-term complications including Post-Concussive Syndrome and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Concerns such as these have brought MTBI to public attention. There is evidence from our group and others that even a single concussive episode can cause long-term changes in the brain that can be visualized by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
Brain iron is highly regulated and has been shown to be abnormal after traumatic brain injury in both animal
and human studies. Though iron is essential for a number of normal cellular processes, it is also implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders as causing toxicity to the brain via the production of oxygen free radicals. Abnormal iron in the brain associated with traumatic brain injury may be a link between trauma and a host of neurodegenerative conditions which have been associated with trauma, including Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and Alzheimer's Disease. We propose to use MRI, including a novel technique called Magnetic Field Correlation, to quantify regional brain iron in vivo after a single concussive episode and to follow changes in brain iron over time. This application has a translational focus and we will study the relationship between brain iron and long-term changes in brain structure as well as the predictive value of brain iron in determining functional changes in the brain and clinical outcome. Identifying and understanding secondary injury such as toxicity from abnormal brain iron is a critical next step in the study of MTBI. Secondary injury cascades can potentially be slowed or stopped and, as such, are excellent potential targets for future development of therapy. The primary long-term objective
of this application is to examine the role of brain iron in MTBI using MRI.

Public,227,CTE and Posttraumatic Neurodegeneration: Neuropathology and Ex Vivo Imaging (UNITE),FITBIR-STUDY0000227,Prospective; Retrospective,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated clinically with progressive cognitive decline and dementia and pathologically with axonal injury and the deposition of multiple aggregated proteins. Repetitive mild TBI can trigger chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a unique tauopathy, and single TBI can provoke an Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, the only way to diagnose these posttraumatic neurodegenerations, including CTE, is by post-mortem brain examination. In order to conduct prospective research into the incidence, prevalence, risk factors, clinical course, and ultimately, treatment for posttraumatic neurodegeneration, consensus criteria for diagnosis as well as objective biomarkers for disease must first be established. This initiative will assemble a multicenter team of expert neuroscientists to evaluate the late effects of TBI, including single and repetitive TBI of varying severity, and CTE, using histological examination of postmortem biospecimens and neuroimaging tools as a foundation to develop in vivo diagnostics. As a first aim, this proposal will bring together a team of 5 accomplished neuropathologists in neurodegenerative disease to establish consensus criteria for the post-mortem diagnosis of CTE. This team will also define the stages of CTE pathology, the features that differentiate CTE from other neurodegenerations and the effects of substance abuse, and the characteristics of posttraumatic neurodegeneration after single TBI. As a second aim, this proposal will establish a national biospecimen and data bank for TBI (Understanding Neurological Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) biobank) by developing a nationwide brain donor registry and hotline to acquire high quality biospecimens and data. The UNITE bank will use strictly standardized protocols and a web-based interface to ensure that tissue and data are readily available to qualified investigators. Comprehensive retrospective clinical data including clinical symptoms, brain trauma and substance abuse history, and medical records (including common data elements) will be entered into a secure database. Behavioral/ mood dysfunction, cognitive changes, substance abuse and traumatic exposure will be correlated with quantitative assessment of the multifocal tauopathy, A? deposition and axonal injury. As a third aim, neuroimaging signatures of the neuropathology will be determined in post-mortem tissue using high spatial resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and autoradiography using a highly selective PET ligand for tau. Quantitative assessment of axonal injury, tau, and A? will be correlated with ex vivo DTI abnormalities and tau ligand autoradiography. Pilot neuroimaging studies of individuals at high risk for the development of CTE will also be conducted in the final 2 years of the proposal. This proposal will determine the clinical and neuroimaging correlates of CTE and posttraumatic neurodegeneration and create the groundwork for establishing their incidence and prevalence.

In addition to this loss of life, the yearly costs of TBI on the health and welfare of children in the US is over $2 billion for acute care along and more than a million life-years are potentially at risk. Advances in care for children with severe TBI have been disappointingly slow. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of novel therapeutic agents and approaches have universally failed when applied in multiple centers. Evidenced-based guidelines are not sufficiently robust to generate meaningful recommendations because the literature has failed to demonstrate best practices for most aspects of TBI care. Variations in practices such as intracranial hypertension control, mitigation of secondary insults and metabolic support are substantial in contemporary clinical practice, leading to wide variations in patient outcomes and may ultimately overwhelm treatment effects that might be observed in a well-designed RCT. We propose an observational cohort study of 1000 children with severe TBI to compare the effectiveness of pediatric TBI therapies within an international consortium from the US, UK and EU. We will test 3 specific aims that encompass a total of 6 TBI therapies - (i) intracranial hypertension strategies - cerebrospinal fluid diversion and hyperosmolar therapies; (ii) secondary insult detection - prophylactic hyperventilation and brain tissue oxygen monitoring (PbO2); (iii) metabolic support - nutritional support and glucose management. Several statistical approaches, often used in comparative effectiveness research (CER) to control for confounders, will be employed including propensity score adjustments, regression analyses and novel statistical modeling.

Public,235,Late Effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (LE-TBI),FITBIR-STUDY0000235,Prospective,"The proposed project, ""Neuropathology of CTE and Late Effects of TBI: Toward In-Vivo Diagnostics"" is a multi- center and multi-disciplinary study designed to dramatically increase our understanding of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and other late effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a major public health concern in the US, as the current prevalence of TBI in the US is unprecedented. Some TBI survivors experience particularly poor outcomes as they age; these include accelerated cognitive and health decline, dementia, and in some cases, CTE. CTE is thought to be a tauopathy but has been described only in convenience samples of people with repetitive head trauma. CTE is incompletely described in individuals with mild, moderate and severe TBI. The population incidence and prevalence, risk factors, and causal role of multifocal tauopathy on associated symptoms are unknown. Overlapping clinical features, postmortem pathologies and patterns of involvement exist in TBI, CTE, and Alzheimer's disease pose challenges to accurate diagnosis. Premortem diagnosis of CTE is currently impossible. The neuropathological consequences of single mild or moderate-severe TBI and its relationship with CTE and known dementias are unclear. The proposed project will leverage extensive resources from an ongoing population-based prospective cohort study of brain aging (Adult Changes in Thought; ACT, n=2,305) which includes excellent medical, behavioral, and genetic characterization of a cohort (20% of whom have a history of mild-moderate TBI) in addition to state-of-the-art neuropathology workup upon death. Neuropathological study of TBI effects can begin immediately in the existing ACT autopsy sample (n=489, 20% with TBI exposure). Additional cohorts of TBI- exposed individuals will come from the Brain Injury Research Center at Mount Sinai (n=150 individuals with moderate-severe TBI), the University of Texas Southwestern (n=50 retired boxers with repetitive TBI exposure), and the National Football League (n=76 retired players with repetitive TBI exposure). All participants in the proposed study (ACT and other sites) will undergo uniform harmonized neurobehavioral assessment (chosen to maximize correspondence with existing large-scale TBI and dementia studies), MRI scan, and genomic analysis.

2. To identify neuroimaging signatures of the neuropathology of CTE and the late effects of TBI as a basis for the development of in vivo diagnostic tools. We will accomplish this by correlating premortem 3T MRI data and two modalities of high resolution post-mortem imaging data with neuropathological data. This information will be used to develop a preliminary neuroimaging protocol that could be used prospectively to characterize in-vivo signatures of post-traumatic neurodegeneration (see Aim 5).

The cumulative effective of multiple concussions necessitates that return-to-activity testing post-concussion are both appropriate and sensitive in determining the readiness of the individual to return to the field. Postural stability has been shown to be a good indicator of recovery following a concussive episode. The Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) is the most widely used clinical assessment of postural stability with post-concussion athletes, yet it lacks adequate quantitative metrics needed to detect subtle changes in stability. The Virtual Environment Traumatic brain injury (TBI) Screen (VETS) device is a new assessment tool that can potentially be used to measure postural stability in healthy and neurologically impaired individuals. The VETS is a variation of our previously approved (closed) IRB approved protocol (20839) for validation of our Therawii (Portable, Instrumented Postural Stability System). The VETS uses a large wide screen TV to display a virtual reality scene to the subject. Two hundred healthy adults will participate in this study.

Public,240,Adding Legacy Clinical Data to the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury: Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT),FITBIR-STUDY0000240,Clinical Trial," Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability. In the United States alone approximately 1.4 million people sustain a TBI each year, of which 50,000 people die and over 200,000 are hospitalized. In addition, new research suggests that TBI is an independent significant risk factor of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Despite the scientific and cost benefits of cross-study analyses, variability in measurement across studies has limited the ability to combine TBI data. To address this, the Federal Interagency TBI Research (FITBIR) Informatics System was developed as a platform to define, refine, and standardize data definitions for performing cross-study TBI research and as a central repository for phenotypic, genomic, and imaging data from TBI studies. The goal of this proposed work is to accelerate the process of building FITBIR into a large, rich database for meta- and secondary analysis of TBI clinical research data by archiving legacy data from the Citicoline Brain Injury Treatment Trial (COBRIT). COBRIT is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter trial studying the effects of 90 days of Citicoline on improving functional outcome in patients with complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI. A comprehensive TBI assessment and drug test data were collected using 43 Case Report Forms (CRFs) in 16 modules containing more than 1,600 variables from approximately 1,200 patients over a 4 year period across eight clinical sites. The archiving of COBRIT in a standardized and harmonized format will help TBI investigators perform cross-study analyses about the natural history of TBI and the feasibility of new TBI therapeutics. Specifically, we will standardize and harmonize COBRIT variables using FITBIR Common Data Elements (CDEs) and Unique Data Elements (UDEs) by (1) assigning CDEs/UDEs to COBRIT variables that are ""Identical"" to FITBIR CDEs/UDEs; (2) defining and annotating COBRIT variables that are ""Comparable"" to FITBIR CDE/UDE; (3) defining and harmonizing COBRIT variables that are ""Related"" to FITBIR CDE/UDEs; and (4) Creating new data elements for COBRIT variables not found in FITBIR CDEs/UDEs. Next, we will contribute the standardized and harmonized COBRIT data to FITBIR by (1) generating FITBIR Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) for COBRIT subjects; (2) validating data formats using the FITBIR Data Validation Tool; and (3) submitting standardized and harmonized COBRIT data using the FITBIR Upload Tool.

Public,242,Bright Light Therapy for Treatment of Sleep Problems Following Mild TBI,FITBIR-STUDY0000242,Clinical Trial,"Sleep disruption of one of the most common complaints in patients suffering from traumatic brain injuries and is associated with poorer outcome. It has been suggested that mTBI might produce alterations of the normal circadian rhythm, leading to delayed sleep phase syndrome and irregular sleep-wake patterns. A particularly promising non-pharmacologic approach that shows potential in improving/modifying abnormalities of the circadian rhythm and sleep-wake schedule is bright light therapy, particularly within the blue-wavelength spectrum.  Presently, no published studies have examined the effects of bright or blue-enriched light therapy on outcome in mTBI patients. For the proposed investigation, we hypothesize that blue wavelength light therapy may be helpful in improving the sleep of patients with a recent history of mTBI and may also have other mood elevating effects, both of which should promote positive treatment outcome in these individuals. We propose that direct intervention to improve the sleep difficulties in mTBI via blue light therapy may lead to entrainment of the circadian rhythm, improved sleep, and enhancement of daytime alertness. These improvements are predicted to lead to improved emotional regulation, neurocognitive performance, and accelerated improvement in symptoms among patients with mTBI.

The primary aims of the proposed study are to examine the effectiveness of an six-week course of morning blue light therapy (MBLT) on objective and subjective measures of sleep, emotional functioning, mood, psychiatric symptom expression, and neuropsychological assessment using the most current version of the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric (ANAM4) TBI battery. In addition, changes in behavioral functioning produced by MBLT will also be correlated with changes in Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an executive control task, a virtual reality water-maze task that assesses hippocampal memory function, and a working memory n-back task. These tasks have been used extensively in our laboratory and provide excellent resolution for evaluating functional changes within the target regions of the anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, the proposed project will directly assess sleep functioning using actigraphy and correlate these changes in sleep with pre-to post-treatment changes in neurocognitive performance and symptom presentation, as well as functional activity changes.

Public,247,Managing Severe TBI without ICP Monitoring-Guidelines Development and Testing (CBG Study),FITBIR-STUDY0000247,"Other, specify","Management of intracranial hypertension (ICH) in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is crucial to their survival and optimal recovery. The evidence-based Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, 3rd Edition recommends use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors to assess ICH and know when and how to intervene. Unfortunately in most areas of the world there is no access to ICP monitor technology. This means that most people with severe TBI are treated without use of ICP monitoring. There are no guidelines and no literature on how to treat severe TBI without use of ICP monitors.

The objective of this project is to create guidelines for the treatment of severe TBI in the absence of ICP monitoring and test them. We propose to derive these guidelines by working with a team of clinicians that practice in austere environments in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) and routinely make decisions based either on a treatment protocol, their clinical experience, or both. We will use a new, systematic and innovative technology and process to accomplish consensus for the guidelines among the clinicians. We will implement the Consensus-Based Guidelines (CBG) in resource-poor centers, some of which have prior exposure to less well developed ad hoc protocols for treatment of TBI, and others that do not have prior exposure. We will test the influence of the CBG on outcomes of severe TBI in a before/after design in these two sets of centers. In the first two years, patients will be treated according to the ad hoc protocol or according to individual clinician best judgment. Then the Guidelines will be developed, all sites will be trained in their use, and they will be used to guide treatment in all sites for the next 2 years. .We will evaluate the effect of using an ad hoc protocol by comparing outcomes between the two sets of centers before the Guidelines are developed. In each set of centers we will evaluate the effect of using the consensus-based guideline protocol compared to either no protocol or the ad hoc protocol by comparing the outcomes in the first and second periods. Finally, we will evaluate how much more the consensus-based protocol effects outcome than the ad hoc protocol by comparing the difference from the first to the second period between the two sets of sites In accomplishing the study objectives, we will create and test a guideline for the treatment of severe TBI that could be used globally to improve outcomes for these patients. We will validate in LMICs a new, systematic and innovative technology and process to accomplish consensus that was derived in an HIC. Finally, we will train personnel in centers new to research in how to conduct high-quality scientific studies, and will extend the training for the personnel with whom we have been working, solidifying previous capacity-building efforts, and initiating new efforts

Public,249,Effects of Erythropoietin on Cerebral Vascular Dysfunction and Anemia in Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000249,Clinical Trial,"Importance: There is limited information about the effect of erythropoietin or a high transfusion threshold in traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Objective: To compare the effects of erythropoietin and two transfusion thresholds (7 and 10 g/dl) on neurological recovery after TBI.

Design: Randomized trial using a factorial design to test: i.) whether erythropoietin would fail to improve favorable outcomes by 20%, and ii.) whether a transfusion threshold of >10 g/dl would increase favorable outcomes without increasing complications.

Setting: Neurosurgical intensive care units of two Houston level 1 trauma centers

Participants: Between May 2006 and August 2012, 200 patients with closed head injury who were unable to follow commands were enrolled within 6 hours of injury; 102 patients received erythropoetin and 98 received placebo. Erythropoetin or placebo was initially dosed daily for 3 days and then weekly for 2 more weeks (n=74) and then the 24h and 48h doses were dropped for the remainder (n=126). Ninety-nine and 101 patients were assigned to the 7g/dl and 10g/dl transfusion thresholds.

Intervention:  Intravenous erythropoietin 500 IU/kg or saline per dose.  Transfusion threshold maintained with packed red blood cell transfusion.

Main Outcome: Glasgow Outcome Scale dichotomized as favorable (good recovery and moderate disability) and unfavorable (severe disability, vegetative, or dead) at 6 months post-injury.

Results: There was no erythropoeitin-transfusion threshold interaction. Compared to placebo (favorable outcome rate: 34/89 [38.2%]; 95%CI=28.2-49.1%), both erythropoetin groups were futile (first dosing regimen: 17/35 [48.6%]; 95%CI=31.4-66.0%, p=0.13, and second dosing regimen: 17/57 [29.8%]; 95%CI=18.4-43.4%, p<0.001). Favorable outcome rates were 37/87 (42.5%) and 31/94 (33.0%) in the 7 and 10 g/dl threshold groups (95%CI for the difference = -0.05 to 0.25, p=0.28). There was a higher incidence of thromboembolic events in the 10 g/dl threshold group (22/101 [21.8%] vs. 8/99 [8.1%], p=0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance: In patients with closed head injury, neither the administration of erythropoietin nor maintaining hemoglobin concentration > 10 g/dl resulted in improved neurological outcome at 6 months and the 10 g/dl threshold was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events..  These findings do not support either approach in this setting.

The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the utility of a novel, clinically-relevant measure of somatosensory information processing (SSIP) as a biomarker for youth SRC and recovery from SRC with relevance for evaluating the neurologic basis of SRC and recovery from SRC. The SSIP testing battery makes use of inexpensive, portable technology to deliver vibrotactile stimuli to the fingertips and does not require baseline data, making it readily applicable for widespread use in schools and on sidelines. The aims of this project are to 1) evaluate the sensitivity of SSIP to youth SRC and recovery from SRC and 2) to assess the neurological basis of SSIP in youth with SRC through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) evaluation of GABA and glutamate in sensorimotor cortex.  We will evaluate 25 youth aged 13-17 years with SRC within 1 week post-injury and again 2-3 weeks post-injury; youth who remain symptomatic from SRC at the second visit will return for a third visit after they have achieved clinically recovery. We will compare SSIP and MRS GABA and glutamate in youth with SRC within 1 week post-injury to that of age- and gender-matched peer athletes with no history of concussion and will evaluate for correlation of SSIP with MRS GABA and glutamate. We will evaluate changes in SSIP and MRS in association with clinical recovery from SRC versus persisting symptoms from SRC. Lastly, we will evaluate whether alterations in SSIP or MRS GABA or glutamate persist even after clinical recovery from SRC, as this may represent a marker for predicting short-term outcome from subsequent SRC and/or emergence of late concussion-related deficits (such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy).

Public,254,Predictors of PTSD and Post Concussive Syndrome in OIF/OEF Veterans (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000254,"Other, specify","Purpose:  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are linked to worsened physical and mental health, functional impairment, and greater healthcare utilization. TBI is a point of injury diagnosis, but Post Concussive Syndrome (PCS) is analogous to the more persistent PTSD. Current treatments are often ineffective, and many afflicted military service members (SMs) never return to duty. Upon return from deployment, many SMs experience an initial honeymoon period during which symptoms are limited in number and scope, but this is frequently followed by a sharp increase in symptoms within months. Identification of independent predictors of PTSD and PCS upon return from deployment could facilitate early intervention to prevent disability. We therefore recruited a cohort of service members from across the nation, broadly representative of the military, and performed a comprehensive baseline assessment, including demographics, neuropsychological assessment, genetic and neuroendocrine assays, brain imaging and synchronization, vestibular, olfactory, and psychophysiologic measures, of SMs within 2 months post- deployment. Subsequent follow-up evaluations at 3, 6, and 12 months assessed for the interim development of PTSD, depression or PCS.
Research Design:  A prospective cohort study involving 81 healthy combat veterans recruited within 2 months after return from Iraq or Afghanistan, with serial evaluations to assess for development of PTSD, depression or PCS, to then determine the baseline factors most strongly predictive of these outcomes.
Methodology/Technical Approach: Questionnaires, imaging, serum catecholamine assays, and baseline physiologic measures were repeated 3, 6, and 12 months after the baseline assessment. Of 103 screened participants, 85 were enrolled, but 4 were therefore excluded because they already met criteria for PTSD, resulting in a cohort of 81. A total of 69 participants completed at least one follow up assessment, including 54 at 3 months, 39 at 6 months, and 57 at 12 months. Cumulatively, we identified an outcome of interest in seven participants: 5 with PTSD, 1 with depress and 1 with PCS. We are now continuing with serial univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the baseline measures most strongly associated with subsequent outcomes of interest.
Results: We identified significant associations between PTSD symptoms at baseline and psychophysiologic responses to stressful stimuli. We also documented fMRI evidence that those with more PTSD symptoms had to exert greater control to stay on task in the face of emotional distractors. Using a nested case-control analysis, we found differences in fractional anisotropy in a key brain area in participants with combat TBI, suggesting a potential mechanism for subsequent symptoms of PCS and functional impairment. Finally, we also found preliminary evidence that heart rate variability may predict subsequent PTSD.
Conclusions: Analyses are still in progress to document the most robust predictors of neurocognitive impairment after combat, but our preliminary analyses identify a number of promising factors that may help us to risk stratify service members after deployment

Public,255,Integrating Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems Data into the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research Informatics System,FITBIR-STUDY0000255,"Other, specify: Other","Background: Since 1989, the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Model System (TBIMS) Program has enrolled over 12,000 adults with moderate to severe TBI in a National Database (NDB) and collected longitudinal follow-up data at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 years post injury.  The Federal Interagency TBI Research (FITBIR) Informatics System has been established to accelerate TBI research by operationalizing precise definitions of common data elements (CDEs) selected for consistent use in TBI research, and to serve as a repository for housing CDEs and other variables collected across the many TBI research studies.

Objective: The ultimate objective of this project is to incorporate data from the TBIMS NDB into FITBIR for easy access and linking to other TBI studies by the TBI research community.

Specific Aims: The specific aims of this proposed one year project are to evaluate: 1) the compatibility of the data sharing policies and procedures between the TBIMS and FITBIR, 2) the exact crosswalk between the TBIMS NDB and the TBI CDEs implemented by FITBIR, 3) the degree to which TBIMS variables can be converted to FITBIR CDEs, aliases, and new data elements, and these variables formatted in existing published or new FITBIR data forms, 4) the feasibility of downloading a de-identified version  of the current TBIMS NDB to FITBIR, 5) the feasibility of adding the FITBIR Global Unique Indentifier (GUID) over time as new and existing patients are contacted for data collection, and 6) the feasibility of prospectively collecting more CDEs that are not currently variables in the TBIMS NDB by a sample of current TBI Model Systems.

Study Design: Project aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished by staff at the TBIMS National Data and Statistical Center (TBINDSC) reviewing policy documents and variable definitions established by both TBIMS and FITBIR; aims 3 and 4 will involve TBINDSC staff following and implementing the detailed protocols for preparing and submitting data to FITBIR; and aims 5 and 6 will require the TBINDSC staff managing the consent and data collection process at the TBIMS Centers to test implementation of the GUID and new CDEs.

Relevance: The TBIMS NDB is the oldest and largest longitudinal TBI database with valuable information describing the natural course of TBI recovery and the trajectories of long-term outcomes.  Incorporating these data into FITBIR would expedite its access by the broader TBI research community for research planning and comparative purposes, thereby facilitating the mission of FITBIR to accelerate TBI research.

Public,256,Frontoparietal priority maps as biomarkers for mTBI,FITBIR-STUDY0000256,Observational,"Background: During viewing of complex scenes, eye movements are planned in high-level regions of the brain. Just as eye movements are directed towards particular locations in space, attention can be focused on discrete locations in a visual scene; the neural mechanisms of visual spatial attention and eye movements strongly indicates that there is a great deal of overlap between the two systems. Accurate eye movements and successful re-direction of attention therefore require intact function in frontal and parietal cortical regions. We propose a series of behavioral and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments that will determine the degree to which difficulties with visual attention, saccade targeting and motion perception associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can be attributed to damaged cortical brain networks serving attention and eye movement planning. Broadly, the Focus Area is mitigation and treatment of visual dysfunction associated with mTBI. Specifically: the objective of this research is to identify biomarkers of visual system injuries in the brain associated with mTBI.

Objective/Hypothesis: The proposed research will test the hypothesis that spatial attention and eye movement deficits associated with mTBI result from disruption of the gray matter and/or the white matter in cortical networks that control attention allocation and eye movements. A combination of functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging will allow us to measure (1) integrity in cortical networks in frontal and parietal brain regions responsible for attention allocation and eye-movement planning, and (2) integrity in the white matter that contains the axons that carry the outputs of these cortical computations to the sub-cortical nuclei that actually control eye movements.

Specific Aim 1 is to establish a measure of the health of visual spatial attention and eye-movement planning networks. In this aim, we hypothesize that fronto-parietal priority networks show reduced selectivity for spatial location in subjects who demonstrate relatively weak spatial attention performance. Our objective is to quantify(1) performance on tasks that require either spatial attention allocation or eye movements and (2) contrast-to-noise ratio, as measured with functional MRI, in brain regions with spatial attention and eye movement.

Specific Aim 2 is to determine strength of correlation between frontoparietal white matter fractional anisotropy and accuracy of eye movements. We hypothesize that damage to cortical white matter impairs eye-movement. Our objective is to measure, in the same scanning session as Aim 1, the white matter integrity in the WM tracts carrying information within and from the fronto-parietal priority network.

Study design: For Aim 1, the association between behavioral and neuroimaging measures (assessed in two study visits, each 2h long) will be measured within a group of 24 subjects with mTBI and weak spatial attention skills. Results will be compared against a control group of 24 subjects with TBI but no visual complaints.

Performance on static tasks that do not require attention shifting, eye movement or motion perception will be measured to test whether association with neuroimaging data is specific to oculomotor skills. For Aim 2, the associations between successful eye movements, successful visual attention allocation, and white matter integrity in four a priori frontoparietal regions of interest (and 2 control regions) will be quantified. Again, performance on static tasks that do not require eye movement or motion perception will be measured to test whether the association with fronto-parietal FA measurements is specific to oculomotor skills.

Public,260,rTMS: A Treatment to Restore Function after Severe TBI,FITBIR-STUDY0000260,Clinical Trial,"There were 2,709 military personnel deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, between 2000 and 2012, who experienced a severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) during combat deployment. Severe TBI is a particularly devastating catastrophic injury with some survivors recovering full consciousness swiftly and others experiencing an extended period of seriously impaired consciousness, but both recovery trajectories involve complex and potentially chronic cognitive and physical impairment.  While there is a growing body of evidence indicating that this devastating injury is modifiable, there are few to no treatments that induce or accelerate functional adaptive recovery after severe TBI.

The objective is to improve recovery of functional skills for persons living in states of seriously impaired consciousness 3 to 12 months after severe TBI. This will be achieved by determining the neurobehavioral and neural effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is a non-invasive technique to stimulate the brain. Excitatory rTMS protocols have been examined for therapeutic effect for depression and stroke and this evidence indicates that rTMS can be used to induce local, remote and distributed neural activity that drives improvement of symptoms and functional recovery. Our preliminary rTMS data with severe TBI indicates that neurobehavioral functioning, functional neural activation and functional and structural connectivity within the language and the default mode networks improved during provision of rTMS.

Specific Aims: Aim I will determine presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS-induced neurobehavioral effects measured with the Disability Rating Scale.  Aim II will determine the presence, direction and sustainability of rTMS-induced changes in functional neural activation and whether or not these changes correlate with improving neurobehavioral function.  Functional neural activation will be examined according to resting state functional connectivity (fcMRI), resting state EEG (EEG-Rest) and neural activation in response to language processing tasks using fMRI and EEG-Task. Aim III will examine the effect of rTMS on white fiber tracts and whether or not the rTMS-related effects correlate with improving neurobehavioral function. Analyses for Aims II and III include focused examinations of changes in functional and structural connectivity within in the language and default mode networks.  Aim IV addresses the need to confirm rTMS safety for severe TBI.

This study is a double blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial using repeated measures.   Individuals in states of seriously impaired consciousness 3 to 12 months after severe traumatic brain injury will be considered for enrollment.  Participants will be randomly assigned to an active rTMS treatment group or a sham rTMS treatment group.  All participants will be admitted to an acute hospital bed at one of three participant enrollment sites.  Study participation will last for approximately 10 weeks.  Bedside neurobehavioral measures, physical measures, EEG-Rest and EEG-Task as well as functional Neuroimaging procedures will be conducted.  Weekly telephone follow-up will be employed for three weeks between completion of the rTMS and re-admission to the research site for final testing.

Although much effort has been placed on trying to better understand this type of injury, many of these studies have been forced to rely largely on self-reporting, retrospective medical records review or evaluations of only later stages of injury No study to date has prospectively followed active-duty US military from concussive brain injury to long-term outcome with advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical evaluation.",Completed,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Christine MacDonald, PhD', 'email': 'cmacd@uw.edu', 'orgName': 'University of Washington'}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Doug Theriaque', 'email': 'dtheriaque@rti.org', 'orgName': 'RTI International'}]","[{'siteName': 'University of Washington', 'address': '4060 NE Stevens Way', 'city': 'Seattle', 'state': 'WA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],['W81XWH1320095'],DoD-MRDC,"['observational', 'military', 'mildTBI', 'controls', 'civilian', 'CENC', 'longitudinal', 'cohort']",[],['Clinical Assessment'],"The overall goal of this study is to investigate advanced MR imaging and clinical outcome measures of concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI) in US military personnel injured during deployment. As part of previous collaborative efforts, we completed early prospective, longitudinal studies enrolling active-duty US military at 0-7 days, 0-30 days, and 0-90 days post-injury. All subjects met the DoD definition for mild? uncomplicated traumatic brain injury . Non-brain? injured control subjects were also enrolled at each time point for comparison. Early advanced MR imaging and clinical information was collected before these subjects were followed to 6-12 months. At 6- 12 months, advanced MR imaging was repeated and a battery of neurological, neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations were completed. In total, 591subjects were enrolled through these efforts;54% TBI,46% control. This study will re-examine these subjects now 3-5 years post-injury and compare their current clinical and imaging presentation with the previously acquired longitudinal data.

Two groups of subjects will be studied: 1) subjects who sustained a concussive brain injury from blast during deployment, and 2) subjects without history of blast exposure and no diagnosis of brain injury from deployment. Group 2 serves as a control population for the blast-related concussive brain injury group.

We hypothesize that early clinical and imaging measures will correlate with 3 to 5 year late stage clinical outcome. This will offer predictive insight into the long-term impact of war-time concussive TBI thereby guiding new recommendations for clinical management and therapeutic intervention.",2013-07-01,2018-06-30,100.0,10.23718/FITBIR/1504245,

Public,266,AIM: TBI Impact of Aging on the Immune Response to Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000266,Natural History,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults is common, accounting for over 25% of brain injuries in the US each year, with considerable mortality, long-term impairment and disability. Outcomes among older adults with TBI are disparately worse when compared to their younger counterparts with similar injuries. Clinical efforts to treat TBI in older adults have not yielded the expected improvements in physical impairment, disability and health- related quality of life. A critical barrier to the management of TBI is that there is limited knowledge about potential differences in the response to TBI that results from aging, and how older age may affect pathology and recovery following TBI. The current application proposes to use a novel set of immune biomarkers to enhance knowledge of the trajectory of recovery from TBI and the underlying mechanisms responsible for chronic symptoms, impairment and decrements in health-related quality of life in older adults following TBI. We propose that aging is a biological factor that contributes to the pathological response to injury by modulating the immune response to TBI and will test this hypothesis using a novel model of impairment and disability. The aims of this prospective cohort study are to: 1) Compare cellular immune responses, plasma inflammatory biomarker concentrations, and measures of impairments, disability and health-related quality of life up to 6 months post-injury in young and older adults with and without mild TBI (75 per group) and 2) Determine the association between selected cellular immune and plasma biomarkers and impairments, disability and health- related quality of life at 3 and 6 months post-injury in older adults with mild TBI.",Completed,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Chris Panks', 'email': 'cpanks@u.washington.edu', 'orgName': 'University of Washington'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Hilaire J Thompson', 'email': 'hilairet@uw.edu ', 'orgName': 'University of Washington'}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Karen Segar', 'email': 'ksegar@uw.edu', 'orgName': 'University of Washington', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'University of Washington', 'address': 'Box 357266', 'city': 'Seattle', 'state': 'WA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}, {'siteName': 'Harborview Medical Center', 'address': '325 9th Ave', 'city': 'Seattle', 'state': 'WA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],['4R01NS077913-05'],NIH-NINDS,[],[],['Clinical Assessment'],"The aims of this prospective cohort study are to: 1) Compare cellular immune responses, plasma inflammatory biomarker concentrations, and measures of impairments, disability and health-related quality of life up to 6 months post-injury in young and older adults with and without mild TBI (75 per group) and 2) Determine the association between selected cellular immune and plasma biomarkers and impairments, disability and health- related quality of life at 3 and 6 months post-injury in older adults with mild TBI.

Public,267,Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) - Adult,FITBIR-STUDY0000267,Epidemiology,"Effective treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the greatest unmet needs in public health. Each year in the US, at least 1.7 million people suffer TBI; an estimated 3.2 to 5.3 million people live with the long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological health disabilities of TBI, with annual direct and indirect costs estimated at over $60 billion. The unique public-private partnership of investigators, philanthropy, and industry leaders brought together in the multicenter Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) proposal share a mission to accelerate clinical research in TBI. The goal is to create a large, high quality TBI database that integrates clinical, imaging, proteomic, genomic, and outcome biomarkers, and provides analytic tools and resources to establish more precise methods for TBI diagnosis and prognosis, improve outcome assessment, and compare the effectiveness and costs of tests, treatments, and services. The investigators hypothesize that this approach will permit better characterization and stratification of patients, allowing meaningful comparisons of treatments and outcomes, and thereby improving the next generation of clinical trials.
Specific Aim 1. To create a widely accessible, comprehensive TBI Information Commons that integrates clinical, imaging, proteomic, genomic, and outcome biomarkers from subjects across the age and injury spectra, and provides analytic tools and resources to support TBI research.
Specific Aim 2. To validate imaging, proteomic, and genetic biomarkers that will improve classification of TBI, permit appropriate choice and stratification of patients for clinical trials, and contribute to the development of a new taxonomy for TBI.
Specific Aim 3. To evaluate a flexible outcome assessment battery comprised of a broad range of TBI common data elements that enables assessment of multiple outcome domains across all phases of recovery and at all levels of TBI severity.
Specific Aim 4. To determine which tests, treatments, and services are effective and appropriate for which TBI patients, and use this evidence to recommend practices that offer the best value.
The project will directly impact public health by creating an open-access Information Commons populated with robust Common Data Elements that will make international research collaboration a reality. Detailed clinical data on 3,000 subjects (11 sites) across the injury spectrum, along with CT/MRI imaging, blood biospecimens, and detailed outcomes, will be collected and analyzed, permitting the identification/validation of biomarkers, and identification of structural abnormalities that may be predictive of outcomes, making strides toward a new taxonomy for TBI. The infrastructure of integrated databases and imaging and biosample repositories will create a high quality, legacy database for current and future generations of international researchers.

Public,269,Evaluation of Spot Light: A concussion injury management app for youth,FITBIR-STUDY0000269,"Other, specify","Sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), including mTBIs?commonly referred to as concussions?are a serious public health concern. Although most sports-related concussions are mild injuries TBIs contribute to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. While contact sports such as football have the highest incidence and rates of concussion, these injuries occur across a wide range of sports. Diagnostic criteria and consensus return to play (RTP) guidelines exist, but clinicians have varying approaches to the
diagnosis and management of sports-related concussion as these guidelines are almost completely unsupported by an evidence base. It is well known that by increasing awareness of concussion signs and symptoms as well as the importance of addressing this injury, improving coaching on proper sports activity techniques and good sportsmanship, providing appropriate protective equipment, and quickly responding to injuries, the incidence, severity, and long-term negative health effects of sports-related concussion among children and adolescents can be reduced. Thus there is a critical need for the development of tools for prevention. Our long-term goal is to reduce the negative consequences of sports-related concussion, specifically in youth sports. The overall objective of this application, which is the first step toward attainment of
our long-term goal, is to evaluate the effectiveness of Spot Light (a concussion injury management application [app] that coordinates diagnosis, management, and RTP procedures from injury to safe return to sport) when utilized by youth football teams. Our central hypothesis is that youth football teams randomized to receive Spot Light will report increased rates of concussion, increased referrals to physicians for care, and increased athlete compliance with RTP guidelines. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that providing an easy to-
use app has a high probability of effectively helping people involved with youth sports better recognize, respond to, and ensure athletes are fully recovered from sports-related concussion. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following aims: 1: Evaluate whether Spot Light will increase reported rates of sports-related concussion; Aim 2: Evaluate whether Spot Light increases referrals to physicians following concussion; Aim 3: Evaluate whether Spot Light improves the management of sports-related concussion. We expect to determine
whether there is increased reporting, referrals to physicians, and athlete compliance with RTP guidelines. This contribution will be significant because it will allow physicians, athletic trainers (ATs), coaches, and parents to collaboratively track concussions from injury through safe RTP thereby lessoning the chances of long-term negative outcomes as well as acute catastrophic outcomes. This research is innovative because it will have both immediate and long-term impacts on the scientific knowledge in the areas of sports injury prevention and the use of mobile app technology as a tool for injury recognition, management/treatment, and prevention.

Public,270,Early Recognition of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Through FDDNP PET Imaging,FITBIR-STUDY0000270,Clinical Trial,"Blast injuries and other head injuries sustained in battle have been associated with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This disorder is considered to be a progressive neurodegenerative disease manifest by cognitive, motoric, and behavioral impairment, possibly including post traumatic stress disorder in the military. Cumulative head trauma is also linked to CTE in other settings such as professional contact/combat sports.

Pathological series have indicated that a characteristic feature of CTE is accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Recent animal models of blast injuries have reported that tau is expressed very early after trauma. Moreover, it has been discovered that tau, once expressed, can spread from cell to cell on an ongoing basis.

Our understanding of the natural history of CTE is limited to say the least. Most previous studies examining the effects of cumulative head trauma are cross sectional, retrospective, utilize single outcomes (either psychometric or imaging), or did not have access to newer investigative technology including new imaging technology. Having the ability to image tau deposition during life in those exposed to repetitive head trauma, and showing an association between this and a behavioral marker such as cognitive test scores, will provide a tool to expand our understanding of the course and manifestations of CTE in the living human.

Until very recently, there has been no reliable way of measuring tau deposition in the brain during life. Rather, families of affected individuals waited until autopsy for a confirmed diagnosis.  One PET biomarker, F-FDDNP (2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl} ethylidene) malononitrile) [FDDNP] has shown sensitivity for in vivo detection of tau in addition to brain amyloid neuroaggregates, and beta amyloid among others. This ligand has been used in Alzheimer?s disease, frontotemporal lobe dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy to establish associations between neuroaggregate deposition and behavior. There is a relationship between the extent of tau deposition in the brain, neuronal losses and level of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer?s disease, suggesting that increased deposition is related to further decline.

This project will examine whether FDDNP PET imaging correlates with, and/or can predict, decline in  cognitive function in  those exposed to cumulative head trauma. Furthermore, experience will be gained regarding the value of FDDNP PET in early (possibly preclinical) identification of developing neurodegeneration such as CTE.

Public,271,Effects of Rapid-Resisted Exercise on Ambulatory Adults with Traumatic Brain Injury (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000271,Natural History,"Background:

Traumatic brain injury may have a range of effects, from severe and permanent disability to more subtle functional and cognitive deficits that often go undetected during initial treatment. To improve treatments and therapies and to provide a uniform quality of care, more research is needed into different treatments for traumatic brain injury.
Exercise has been shown to improve movement and balance in people with strokes, cerebral palsy, and other conditions that affect the brain, and can improve symptoms of memory problems or depression. Bright light therapy has also been shown to improve mood in people with depression. Researchers are interested in studying problems with movement, balance, thinking, and mood in people with traumatic brain injury. By comparing the effects of exercise and bright light exposure on brain function, new treatments may be developed for acute traumatic brain injury.
Objectives:

- To compare the effects of exercise and bright light therapy on the brain function of individuals with traumatic brain injury.

Eligibility:

- Individuals between 18 and 44 years of age who either have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury or are healthy volunteers.

Design:

?Individuals with traumatic brain injury will have four outpatient evaluation visits at the clinical center, a 3-month home exercise program, and a 3-month bright light exposure program at home. Healthy volunteers will have one evaluation visit at the clinical center.
At the first study visit, all participants will have a full physical examination and medical history. Individuals with traumatic brain injury will also have an eye exam to determine if it is safe for them to receive light therapy.
All participants will have the following initial tests:
Tests of walking and movement, including monitoring by a physical therapist; tests to record joint movement and evaluate muscle function; tests that combine movement, thinking, and speaking; and balance and reaction time tests.
Magnetic resonance imaging scans
Tests of thinking and mood, including questionnaires, computerized tests, and simple action tests.
Participants with traumatic brain injury will have separate 3-month sessions of exercise and bright light therapy, with additional evaluation visits between each 3-month session and at the end of the study. Between the 3-month sessions, participants will have 1 month with no intervention.
Exercise sessions will involve regular workouts on an elliptical machine for 30 minutes for 5 days a week, and bright light therapy sessions will involve sitting in front of a light box for 30 minutes for 5 days a week. Participants will keep a journal to monitor the effects of the therapy.

Public,272,Biomarkers-Driven Development of Experiemental Therapeutics for Traumatic Brain Injury (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000272,Clinical Trial,"Background:

- A person who has a traumatic brain injury (TBI) -- also called concussion -- can have serious and long-lasting effects. Doctors who treat TBI need more information about how the brain changes over time in people with TBI and how well a person recovers from it. To make existing TBI treatments more effective and develop new ones, researchers want to look more closely at how TBI affects people both physically and psychologically.

Objectives:

- To collect medical information from people with recent traumatic brain injury and compare this information to that of healthy volunteers and of persons who have had injuries to other parts of their bodies besides their heads (such as broken bones, orthopedic injuries, after surgery).

Eligibility:

3 groups of people between the ages of 18 and 70 years will be asked to take part.

Persons who have had a traumatic brain injury (or concussion ) within the past 30 days, OR
Persons who are healthy and have never had a traumatic brain injury, OR
Persons who have had an injury within the past 30 days to a part of their body other than the head (such as a broken bone, orthopedic injury, surgery)
Design:

This study requires two outpatient visits each lasting 1 1/2 days. The 2 visits will be about 30 days apart. Persons with TBI and non-TBI injuries must have their first visit within 30 days of their injury.
Screening: Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests and electrocradiogram (ECG a routine heart test).

The research will involve:

a.Giving blood samples (no more than 75 ml each visit).
b.Having tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking (neuropsychological testing).
c.Having imaging studies of the head including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

Persons with TBI will have the same tests at Visit 1 and 2. Healthy controls and persons with non-TBI injuries will have the same tests at Visit 1 as listed above. But, at Visit 2, they will not have brain MRIs or PETs.

No treatments will be provided as part of this research protocol.

Public,273,Evaluation Of Longitudinal outcomes in mild TBI Active-Duty Military and Veterans,FITBIR-STUDY0000273,Natural History,"Study In the US military, it is estimated that roughly 20% of the deployed force suffered a head injury1 in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 83.3% of whom endured a mild, uncomplicated TBI or concussion2,3. The long term impact of these injuries is just beginning to be appreciated. Many of these service members are young males, 20-30 years old who have decades of life to live with the complex and often debilitating impact of war-time brain injury. The total lifetime health care costs are largely unknown. Although substantial effort has been placed on trying to better understand this type of injury, much research has been forced to rely largely on self- reporting4-11, retrospective medical records review 12-16, or evaluations of only later stages of injury17, 18. No study to date has prospectively followed active-duty US military from injury to long term outcome with advanced MR imaging and clinical evaluation. The overall goal is to investigate long-term advanced MR imaging measures and clinical outcome of concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during deployment in US military personnel. We will relate these findings to prospectively acquired longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the acute/sub-acute, and early chronic stages following concussion collected on these patients as part of previous collaborative efforts. We hypothesize that early clinical and imaging measures will offer predictive insight into late stage clinical outcome. Study Design: As part of previous collaborative efforts, we have successfully completed early prospective, longitudinal studies enrolling active-duty US military at 0-7 days (median 4), 0-30 days (median 8), and 0-90 days (median 14) post-injury19-21 where early advanced MR imaging and clinical data were collected. In total, 591 subjects were enrolled through these efforts; 54% TBI, 46% control.

Public,274,Biomechanical Basis of Pediatric mTBI Due to Sports Related Concussion,FITBIR-STUDY0000274,Natural History,"We propose to develop a quantitative model of the biomechanical basis of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) for a pediatric population. This expands upon our initial five year Bioengineering Research Partnership (BRP) in which we developed a biomechanical model of MTBI for a collegiate population, which has resulted in a database of more than 500,000 recorded head impacts in collegiate sports. This work has produced substantial advancements in the knowledge of injury mechanisms and head impact exposure, and resulted in translational outcomes, including: 1) adult brain injury criteria that provide improved diagnosis strategies and prevention systems, 2) optimized helmet design criteria and publically available helmet evaluations that have improved helmet technologies, and 3) football practice guidelines that have reduced head impact exposure in collegiate football. The proposed pediatric MTBI model will enable translational research and the development of new clinical and therapeutic approaches to reduce the incidence and negative effects of MTBI in youth athletes. Experimental and clinical projects among our team members will allow us to test hypotheses specific to the underlying pathomechanics and clinical sequelae of pediatric MTBI. A cohort of 1050 youth football players between the ages of 6 and 14 years will wear instrumented helmets to collect head acceleration data and clinical data over a 5 year period. Athletic environments offer a rich opportunity for collecting data on large numbers of head impacts, which enables research that combines biomechanical head impact data with the subsequent neurobiologic and functional changes in the brain. To date, biomechanical MTBI research has focused primarily on the approximately 100,000 athletes participating in college and professional football in the United States; however, little is known about the 3,500,000 youth (6 years to 14 years) athletes playing football each year. We hypothesize that head acceleration due to impact is predictive of the type and severity of brain injury, and correlates t specific clinical measures of pediatric MTBI.

Public,277,Cognitive rehabilitation: ACTION training for soldiers with executive dysfunction,FITBIR-STUDY0000277,Epidemiology,"Many Service members (SM) experience executive dysfunction associated with mild traumatic brain injury symptom complex (mTBI-sc), for which they receive cognitive rehabilitation. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) for executive dysfunction often involves metacognitive strategy instruction (MSI) to help patients self-regulate their behavior though a goal management process - identifying a goal, anticipating performance problems, generating possible solutions, self-monitoring performance during the activity, recognizing maladaptive task strategies, stopping and then modifying real-time task behavior by choosing an alternate strategy. MSI alone often does not result in improved daily functioning because it requires conscious cognitive oversight to employ (which is difficult for people with executive dysfunction) and it presumes that simply establishing goals propels goal-directed action, when for many people, this is not so. Social psychologists report that people who set implementation intentions (if-then statements that link specific situational cues with specific goal actions) are more likely to perform goal actions than those who only set goal intentions. Implementation intentions are believed to be effective because they enable people to switch from conscious-effortful reflective action control to automatic, reflexive action control associated with selected situational cues. A team of researchers from the Courage Kenny Research Center (CKRC), Traumatic Brain Injury Center at Fort Campbell, KY (TBIC-FC), and Neurofunctional Research and Consulting has developed a brief CR intervention to teach SM with mTBI-sc to set implementation intentions called ACTION (AutomatiC iniTiation of IntentiONs) sequence training. The purpose of this pilot study to evaluate: 1) the practicality of instructional methods used to teach SM with mTBI-sc to perform the ACTION sequence and 2) the efficacy of ACTION sequence training in achieving personal goals and performance on a task that challenges executive function using a small randomized controlled trial.

While research over the last decade has significantly advanced the science of mTBI, a comprehensive neurobiopsychosocial model of mTBI is yet to be achieved.

Objective/Hypothesis:  With the goal of conducting the most comprehensive study of mTBI to date, this proposal leverages the existing infrastructure of a current DoD-funded study by ?piggy-backing? additional scientific aims that have major significance to our scientific understanding of mTBI.  We hypothesize that there will be a significant correlation between biomechanical, clinical, neurobiological, and neuroradiological markers of mTBI, which will more fully inform a neurobiopsychosocial model of mTBI.
Study Design:  This is a prospective, cohort study that will include pre-exposure baseline assessment of a large sample of athletes enrolled, as well as acute and longitudinal follow-up assessment of a cohort with concussion, a matched control group of non- concussed athlete from the same contact sport, and a noncontact sport athlete control groups.   900 athletes participating in contact sports will undergo extensive pre-exposure baseline clinical, genetic, and biological studies.  A subgroup of 50 contact sport athletes and the noncontact sport control group (n=50) will undergo preseason MRI studies as well.

Public,283,Characterizing Microhemorrhages From Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000283,"Other, specify","The mechanical insult resulting from TBI can cause a shearing of axons and vessels that produces cerebral microhemorrhages. Such findings are common in TBI patients and represent a primary indicator of traumatic and diffuse axonal injury. Studies examining the relationship between microhemorrhages and clinical outcomes in TBI patients have previously been performed with somewhat mixed results. Earlier studies found that although the presence or absence of microhemorrhages is related to clinical outcomes, they may be overly sensitive to brain injury, with their actual counts not correlated to neuropsychological outcome measures. More recent studies have shown that the number and volume of microhemorrhages are in fact, associated with neurologic deficits in pediatric cases of TBI, and in adult cases of mild TBI. This dichotomy may be due to improved imaging techniques or simply different study designs. Nevertheless, the role that microhemorrhages play in the pathophysiology of TBI remains poorly understood. Improved quantitative characterization of microhemorrhages is necessary to better elucidate their functional significance.
Because paramagnetic blood products, like hemosiderin, in microhemorrhages cause local magnetic field inhomogeneities, they are visible as punctate hypointensities on T2*-weighted MRI. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) is a combination of standard T2*-weighted MRI with image post-processing techniques that enhance the visibility of veins and microhemorrhages by incorporating MRI phase data. Figure 1 shows an example of SWI acquired from a TBI patient who received a diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury due to the presence of multiple microhemorrhages (highlighted by red arrows). Because of their small size, microhemorrhages can be difficult to detect even for trained clinicians. In our own study collecting over 200 TBI MRI scans acquired across multiple sites, 30% were found to possess microhemorrhages after careful inspection, but only 6% were detected in a standard clinical read. There exist three primary challenges to enabling improved quantitative analysis of microhemorrhages using MRI across large populations: 1) Because of their small size, standard imaging approaches lack sufficient resolution or require excessive imaging times to effectively detect and delineate microhemorrhages; 2) Standard acquisition and reconstruction techniques suffer from blooming artifacts that can distort their geometry; 3) Previously proposed computational methods to assist in the detection and segmentation of microhemorrhages have poor performance with unacceptably high false positive rates.
This project has two primary aims: 1) Evaluate and optimize accelerated SWI and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) acquisition techniques for improved mapping of microhemorrhages; 2) Develop post-processing methods for automatic detection and analysis of microhemorrhages from T2*-weighted MRI and its derivatives such as SWI and QSM. Aim 1 focuses on phantom and patient studies to evaluate and optimize sequence parameters and phase processing schemes for acquiring images that accurately represent microhemorrhage geometry while preserving contrast and maintaining practical scan times. Patients who are positive for microhemorrhages in the CNRM Screening protocol will be recruited for refining these acquisitions and processing procedures. Aim 2 focuses on building algorithms and software for automatically detecting microhemorrhages, characterizing their size and shape, and mapping their spatial distribution in individuals and groups. In Aim 2, we will also explore the relationship of these microhemorrhage properties with neurobehavioral measures in existing cross-sectional and longitudinal TBI studies. The developed techniques will build upon expertise and prior work in both image acquisition and processing that are unique to this investigative team.

AET-induced adaptation of cardiorespiratory fitness and fatigue severity will be characterized, and time-course for changes in mood reactivity will be determined. We hypothesize that 1) AET will improve both cardiorespiratory fitness and fatigue severity and 2) mood will at first worsen in response to AET but that mood reactivity will then decrease at some point during the intervention.
Subjects:
Thirty-six adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-penetrating TBI (mild, moderate, and severe) will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited from NIH, affiliated hospitals/clinics, and in the community. Enrollment is open to both military and non-military personnel.
Design:
This is a pilot study with a pre-experimental, test-intervention-retest design. Cardiorespiratory fitness, fatigue severity, cognitive performance, and changes in mood reactivity will be measured at baseline. The subjects will then participate in a 12-week treadmill exercise training intervention protocol known to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in the general population. Following the 12 weeks of AET, cardiorespiratory fitness, fatigue severity, and cognitive performance will be retested and compared to baseline. Changes in mood reactivity will be assessed monthly.
Outcome Measures:
AET-induced change in cardiorespiratory fitness as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2) is the primary outcome measure and will be measured by pulmonary gas exchange analysis during treadmill exercise tolerance testing. The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is the principal measurement tool for the fatigue outcome variable. FSS scores will be interpreted in relation to information from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (MOS-36SF), Becks Depression Inventory (BDI), The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Profile of Mood States Short Form (POMS-SF). Change in mood reactivity will be measured as the difference in the POMS-SF scores before and after 30 minutes of recovery. The outcome variable for time-course related change in mood reactivity is the week of onset for significant improvement in mood reactivity.

Public,292,Assessment and Rehabilitation of Traumatic Brain Injury with Virtual Reality Driving Simulation (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000292,"Other, specify","Many individuals who experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI) continue to suffer symptoms long after their injury. Long-term symptoms of TBI often include difficulty focusing, irritability, slowed thinking, or problems with multi-tasking, and can result in problems performing complex tasks, such as completing work duties or driving a car. For example, veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who have suffered a TBI are at a very high risk for getting injured or killed in car accidents after they return from deployment. Unfortunately, there are no proven methods for improving driving safety or cognitive abilities for people with long-term symptoms from TBI. As a result, individuals with TBI are often not able to get the treatments that they need.The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate a promising intervention specifically designed to improve thinking abilities, brain function, and driving safety. This intervention, Virtual Reality (VR) Driving Rehabilitation, uses a realistic VR driving simulator to help patients practice and improve important driving skills, such as braking, merging, driving defensively, dealing with unexpected obstacles, and handling frustration. VR driving rehabilitation provides challenge and engagement necessary to stimulate a wide range of brain functions. Whereas it would be unsafe to place a TBI patient into truly challenging real-world driving situations, VR allows for safe assessment and rehabilitation of driving-relevant skills at the true limits of the patient?s current capabilities. Additionally, specially-designed virtual scenarios can be used to target specific brain functions for rehabilitation at a level that is most beneficial to the patient.Previous work by our research group suggests that VR Driving Rehabilitation is effective at improving driving abilities and reducing road rage among warfighters with moderate to severe TBI. However, additional research among those with moderate to severe TBI is needed to confirm the initial findings, and the effectiveness of VR Driving Rehabilitation after mild TBI has not yet been tested.We will recruit 30 volunteers who have suffered a mild TBI, 30 volunteers who have suffered a moderate-to severe TBI, and 30 healthy control volunteers. Each volunteer will have their brain structure and function systematically measured. Driving abilities will be assessed using virtual reality and weekly telephone/internet assessments of real-world driving safety. Participants with TBI will receive 9 hours of virtual reality driving rehabilitation. A second evaluation will be conducted to measure improvement in brain function and driving abilities associated with virtual reality rehabilitation. Additional telephone follow-ups will be performed six months afterward to evaluate longer-term stability of treatment effects.This study will provide valuable information about ways that TBI affects driving safety, and risk factors for unsafe driving among those who have suffered a TBI. This study will also evaluate VR Driving Rehabilitation as a tool for helping those with TBI to improve their thinking, brain functioning, and driving. If this study confirms that VR Driving Rehabilitation is effective in improving driving safety and enhancing thinking and brain function, this treatment could quickly be made available to military personnel, veterans, and civilians who have suffered a TBI with no expected risks or side effects. These treatments would enable individuals with TBI to be more successful at work or school, minimize their risk for dangerous car accidents, and reduce overall health care costs. This research would also pave the way for further improvements in VR-assisted rehabilitation as this technology continues to evolve and become more widely available.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Dominic Nathan', 'email': 'dominic.nathan.ctr@usuhs.edu', 'orgName': ' CNRM', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Mark Ettenhofer', 'email': 'mark.ettenhofer@usuhs.edu', 'orgName': ' '}]","[{'siteName': 'Primary Site', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],CNRM,[],[],[],,2013-07-01,2016-06-30,,,
Public,293,PET IMAGING OF NEUROINFLAMMATION IN TBI (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000293,,"Brain damage following traumatic injury (TBI) is a result of direct mechanisms, such as mechanical injury to the brain and vasculature, as well as indirect (secondary) mechanisms, such as inflammation. While CT and MRI can help visualize the result of an inflammatory process in the brain, i.e. the development of cerebral edema, neither can be used to document active inflammation. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which is recently renamed as translocator protein (TSPO) is highly expressed in microglia and reactive astrocyte, has been used as a biomarker for positron emission tomography (PET), and is suggestive of an active inflammatory process. Recently we developed a new PET ligand [11C]PBR28, which images TSPO with high levels of specific binding. We have successfully applied [11C]PBR28 in a number of brain disorders such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and HIV infection with minor cognitive motor disorder, and are detecting neuroinflammation. The objective of the exploratory phase of this study is to explore whether [11C]PBR28 PET imaging show changes in subjects with TBI who have shown MRI or CT abnormalities.
Twenty subjects diagnosed with TBI and 20 healthy age matched volunteers will be studied.
No study has been performed to detect increase in TSPO in living TBI subjects. Therefore, we start the study with an exploratory phase where we perform [11C]PBR28 PET scans in TBI subjects who have shown abnormalities in MRI or CT. If the results of this exploratory phase are positive, i.e., [11C]PBR28 PET detects increases in TSPO in the areas where MRI or CT have shown abnormalities, we will extend the project to study longitudinal changes in TSPO in those subjects with MRI or CT abnormalities and also extend the study by including TBI subjects who do not show abnormalities in MRI or CT.",,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Asma Idriss', 'email': 'idrissa@mail.nih.gov', 'orgName': ' '}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Mashahiro Fujita', 'email': 'mashahiro.fujita@nih.gov', 'orgName': ' '}]",[],[],[],,[],[],[],,2009-06-01,2014-06-30,,,
Public,295,THE IMPACT OF GH RELEASING HORMONE ON SLEEP PROMOTION AND ENDOCRINE REGULATION IN SERVICE MEMBERS WHO SUSTAINED A TBI AND DEVELOPED INSOMNIA (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000295,"Other, specify","The number of service members (SMs) who sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) have dramatically increased during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, resulting in approximately 250,000 SMs who report TBI related symptoms or disability. One of the most common complaints in SMs who sustain a TBI is sleep disturbance. Up to one-third of SMs who sustain a TBI are diagnosed with a sleep disorder, with insomnia being one of the most common disorders. Acknowledging the high prevalence of insomnia is this group is essential, as sleep disorders are associated with additional neurocognitive deficits and functional impairments, thereby compromising recovery ability. However, even when insomnia is diagnosed, we are not able to effectively treat it, as our currently available pharmacological agents are effective in less than half of those treated, and are associated with many substantial side effects. We suggest that neuroendocrine dysfunction is one of the important mechanisms linking TBI and disordered sleep, and that pharmacological agents that address this dysfunction will be effective in treating insomnia. The neuroendocrine system includes the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary which are essential to the regulation of normal sleep and circadian function. Since hypopituitarism is common following a TBI, it is likely that sleep disturbance following TBI originates from hypo-function in the sleep centers in the hypothalamus and/or the somatotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary that regulate growth hormone (GH) secretion which promotes non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This relationship has not been determined in clinical studies; however, this assertion is supported by previous studies that demonstrate that growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration promotes sleep in aging individuals, as well as in patients with depression and in healthy controls. Therefore, we suggest that in SMs who sustained a TBI, administration of GHRH will address the underlying mechanisms of insomnia, providing a pharmacological agent that is able to address this critical issue. To determine this we will recruit SM?s with a documented TBI who are diagnosed with insomnia (n=15), and those without sleep disturbance (n=15) from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). Endocrine dysfunction is not required for inclusion in either group. A double blinded randomized crossover design will be used to examine the impact of GHRH (recombinant human GHRH-1,44-amide 4 mg) administered subcutaneously on sleep quality evaluated by a polysomonographic (PSG) in conjunction with serial blood draws to examine endocrine function and neuropeptide release. The following morning a hydrocortisone stimulation test will be used to examine function of the corticotropic axis. An MRI will also be used to examine structure of the hypothalamus and pituitary. Our primary hypothesis is that GHRH administration will result in improved sleep quality in the TBI and insomnia group, resulting in a total sleep time, and number of awakenings that are similar to healthy controls. Our secondary hypothesis is that GHRH administration will regulate overnight neuroendocrine proteins and neuroendocrine function the following morning in the TBI and insomnia groups, resulting in patterns and concentrations that are similar to healthy controls. We expect this study to initiate a program of research that will ultimately develop pharmacological agents that are able to effectively treat and prevent insomnia following TBI. This research program is essential to promote recovery following a TBI, thereby mitigating the morbidity risks associated with TBIs in SMs and civilians.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Asma Idriss', 'email': 'idrissa@mail.nih.gov', 'orgName': ' CNRM', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Jessica Gill', 'email': 'jessica.gill@nih.gov', 'orgName': ' '}]","[{'siteName': 'CNRM', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],CNRM,[],[],[],,2013-07-01,2016-06-30,,,

The support is latched in such a way that it can be released by the subject, travel a short distance, and come to a rigid stop. The resulting acceleration/deceleration is small (in the range of normal activities, such as jumping from a height of 1-2 feet) but sufficient to derive valuable information. on brain biomechanics.

Public,298,EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HEADACHE DISORDERS IN A MILITARY COHORT WITH AND WITHOUT TBI (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000298,,"Migraine or headache is a common problem in the active duty population in the recently deployed population, and is a cardinal symptom of traumatic brain injury (TBI). While there is increasing appreciation of the clinical burden of chronic post-traumatic headache (PTH) in the military population with traumatic brain injury, there are significant research gaps related to the epidemiology of PTH including lack of understanding of natural history, whether there are predisposing factors that predict the development or prognosis of headache post trauma, and, most basically, the features that distinguish PTH from other forms of chronic headache. Although diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic headache (PTH) are included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-IIR), these criteria are somewhat arbitrary and were not empirically defined. This lack of precision about the PTH phenotype limits the rigor of observational and interventional studies of PTH and is a primary research gap. Lack of understanding about predisposing risk factors for the development of PTH is also an important research gap. It will benefit our soldiers if we can identify those who are at greatest risk of developing chronic headache post-trauma and who might therefore benefit from early and aggressive treatment with headache prophylactic agents.
The proposed observational study will address the following research questions:
1) Epidemiology: What is the incidence, prognosis, and natural history of headache disorders in a deployed military population with or without exposure to TBI?
2) Phenotype: Which constellation of symptoms, if any, distinguishes PTH from ?regular? chronic headache and from TBI occurring without headache?
3) Relationship to Injury: To what extent is chronic PTH related to injury severity or modality?
4) Risk Factors: Which factors predict PTH incidence or prognosis, including but not limited to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), co-existing non-headache chronic pain, pre-existing migraine, family history of pain disorders, or replicated pain genes for other chronic pain disorders?",,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Asma Idriss', 'email': 'idrissa@mail.nih.gov', 'orgName': ' '}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Ann Scher', 'email': 'ann.scher@usuhs.edu', 'orgName': ' '}]",[],[],[],,[],[],[],,2011-07-01,2013-06-30,,,
Public,301,MILD BLAST-INDUCED TBI AND RAPID RESPONSE INHIBITION (CNRM),FITBIR-STUDY0000301,,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by explosive blasts accounts for more than 60% of all injuries in the modern battlefield (e.g., the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan). Based on a 2008 estimate, about 57,000 of the returning service personnel have had TBI. Survivors with mild blast-induce TBI (bTBI) during military operations may return to combat duties within days after injury if they no longer show common post concussive symptoms such as headache, problems with memory, concentration, and irritability. However, some basic but important abilities are not easily detected with current military diagnostic procedures. For example, the ability to make rapid decision in a fraction of a second whether to act or not to act when necessary can be compromised after mild bTBI. To be able to respond rapidly during combat can mean life or death not only for the survivor with the injury, but also for the people around. A compromised ability to make rapid responses may also become a risk for a combat operation itself. There is some evidence from civilians with mild TBI that shows a compromised ability to respond rapidly, particularly when an action has to be rapidly stopped or changed. In addition, it is also not known to what extent mild bTBI would cause changes in brain activity and how these changes associated with the ability to make rapid decisions/response may be ameliorated through clinical interventions. This study will focus on answering two questions: 1) whether mild bTBI would result in a compromised ability to make rapid response decisions or to rapidly stop an action; and 2) Whether a particular type of simple brain stimulation technique can improve the ability to make rapid response decisions. Both questions are important for assessing the impact of mild bTBI, determining the fitness of a survivor after the injury to return to combat operations, and for developing an evidence-based strategy to enhance recovery after injury.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Asma Idriss', 'email': 'idrissa@mail.nih.gov', 'orgName': ' '}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Benjamin Xu', 'email': 'Benjamin.Xu@nih.gov', 'orgName': ' '}]",[],[],[],,[],[],[],,2012-07-01,2016-06-30,,,

This information would allow development and application of interventions to target vulnerable individuals, with the goal being the prevention of PTSD.
Measures of brain structure (MRI/DTI/SWI) and function (event-related potentials and neurocognitive testing) will be evaluated at baseline to identify potential markers of risk for PTSD. Outcome will be evaluated three and six months after the baseline assessment using psychiatric interviews (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS] and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV [SCID]), as well as measures of post-concussion symptoms, overall health status (including headache), emotional distress, and perceived quality of life. The full brain assessment battery will be re-administered after six months to explore the course of changes in brain structure and function associated with mild TBI.

Public,305,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: Detection, Diagnosis, Course, and Risk Factors",FITBIR-STUDY0000305,Natural History,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a distinct deposition of an abnormal form of the tau protein in a pattern that is unique from other diseases, including Alzheimer's
disease (AD). CTE has been found most often in professional contact sport athletes (e.g., boxing, football) who
have been subjected to repetitive blows to the head resulting in concussive and subconcussive trauma.
Neuropathologically-confirmed CTE has been reported in individuals as young as 17 and in athletes who only
played sports through high school or college. It also has been found in non-athletes who experienced repetitive
head impacts, including epileptics, victims of physical abuse, and military service members. In contrast to what
may be inferred by the extensive media attention on CTE, the science of CTE remains in its infancy; critical
questions remain, such as whether or not it is a common disease. Although the neuropathological features of
CTE have become further clarified in recent years, the clinical presentation of CTE is still not well
characterized, even though there have been case reports in the literature of ""dementia pugilistica"" in boxers since the early 1900's. Clinical diagnostic criteria have only recently been published and lack validation.
Neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers developed for the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases have only
been used in preliminary studies. There is thus an urgent need to develop accurate methods for detecting and
diagnosing CTE during life so that effective interventions for prevention and treatment can be developed.
Moreover, though a history of repetitive head impacts is a necessary risk factor for CTE, it alone is not
sufficient. There is a need to understand what specific aspects of the head impact exposure places an
individual at increased risk for CTE and to examine potential genetic modifiers of that risk. To address these
needs, we propose a multidisciplinary, multicenter, longitudinal study of former athletes with high exposure to
repetitive head impacts (120 former NFL players with and without symptoms) or medium exposure to repetitive
head impact (60 former college football players with and without symptoms) and a control group of 60
asymptomatic same-age men without any history of repetitive head impact exposure or traumatic brain injury.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Emmanuel A Ojo', 'email': 'eadewumi@bu.edu', 'orgName': 'Boston University School of Public Health'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Robert A Stern, PhD', 'email': 'bobstern@bu.edu', 'orgName': 'Boston University, School of Medicine'}, {'role': 'Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Eric  Reiman, MD', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Banner Alzheimer’s Institute'}, {'role': 'Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Jeffrey Cummings, MD, ScD', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University'}, {'role': 'Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Martha E Shenton, PhD', 'email': 'shenton@bwh.harvard.edu', 'orgName': 'Harvard Medical School'}]","[{'siteName': 'Boston University School of Medicine', 'address': '72 East Concord St  B-7800', 'city': 'Boston', 'state': 'MA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '617-638-5678', 'isPrimary': True}]",['NCT02798185'],"['1U01NS093334-01', '5U01NS093334']",NIH-NINDS,[],[],"['Imaging', 'Clinical Assessment']","The aims of our proposal are: (1) to collect and analyze neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers for the detection of

Public,317,The Quantification of Visual Function and Postural Stability Under Single- and Dual-Task Conditions Using Mobile Technology,FITBIR-STUDY0000317,Natural History,"Recent studies have demonstrated that following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), Soldiers often experience declines in postural stability under single- and dual-task conditions. Similarly, oculomotor and visual impairments are prevalent following mTBI; however, the primary care clinic environment often lacks technology of sufficient resolution and sophistication to accurately detect the subtle abnormalities associated with mTBI-related visual dysfunction. The lack of scalable and adoptable approaches to the objective quantification of postural stability visual function represent fundamental gaps in the detection, assessment, and management of military mTBI and potentially prolongs and complicates the return-to-duty process. The proposed project will address these fundamental diagnostic and treatment gaps. Specifically, our existing validated mobile device assessment of balance and vision will be leveraged to develop ""mobile devices to test balance that can be administered by corpsman-level medical personnel"" and provide ""diagnostic methods"" for the mitigation and treatment of visual dysfunction associated with mTBI that are specifically designed for the unique demands of a military population. Our initial studies and experience clearly indicate this technology is scalable across a large health system and is effectively utilized by all members of the providers including athletic trainers, pediatricians, neurologists, sports medicine physicians, physical therapists, and occupational therapists to ensure continuity of care from injury to return to learn/play. The results from this project will provide the military with a scalable, reliable, affordable, and accurate solution to evaluating postural stability and visual function to aid in optimizing care and return-to-duty.Hypotheses: The fundamental hypotheses being tested are: (1) effective and informative dual-task paradigms can be developed using a mobile device to characterize motor (postural stability) and cognitive (executive function) simultaneously and (2) a mobile device can be used to characterize visual dysfunction that has the potential to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of mTBI.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Susan Linder', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Cleveland Clinic'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Jay Alberts', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Cleveland Clinic'}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Sara Davidson', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Cleveland Clinic'}]","[{'siteName': 'Cleveland Clinic', 'address': '9500 Euclid Ave', 'city': 'Cleveland', 'state': 'OH', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,"['mTBI', 'Neurocognitive', 'Veterans', 'Technology', 'MilitaryPersonnel', 'Visualimpairment', 'Rehabilitationtherapy']",[],['Clinical Assessment'],"To develop and validate a neurocognitive dual-task assessment module in healthy controls that is sensitive in quantifying high-level cognitive-motor function. This aim will be addressed through three related experiments in which two new dual-task modules will be developed for iPad and compared to performance while carrying out a gait and Stroop task using the Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) system at the Cleveland Clinic.Specific Aim 2: To develop and validate a battery of iPad-based assessments for the screening, evaluation, and management of visual impairment in individuals with mTBI. The primary outcome will be performance on iPad App versions of near point convergence, near vertical phoria, near lateral phoria, horizontal vestibular ocular reflex, and low contrast visual acuity compared to an ophthalmic evaluation of the same domains of visual function.Specific Aims 3 and 4: To determine normative values for military Service members (n=200) and age- and gender-matched civilians for the dual-task identified in Aim 1 that best replicates performance on the CAREN + Stroop task and for the iPad visual assessments and measures of reading fluency. Civilian and military normative outcomes will be determined for newly developed balance and visual assessment modules.Specific Aim 5: To evaluate the feasibility of clinical utilization of the newly developed postural stability and vision modules for the iPad in the Cleveland Clinic Concussion (C3) Care Path. Upon completion of the validation projects (Aims 1 and 2), the modules identified as most effective will be integrated in the C3 mobile application (C3 App) for use within the Cleveland Clinic Concussion Care Path to accelerate understanding the clinical value of these assessments in influencing clinical practice and return-to-play.Study Design: A two-phase prospective project is proposed. The mobile technology will be developed and validated in healthy young civilian adults (18-25 years). Once validated, military and civilian norms will be collected using healthy young civilians and Service members (18-25 years). Military personnel will be recruited through an emerging relationship with the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) during the in-processing of Service members.Military Benefit: Currently, there is no systematic approach that is scalable or practical to implement to the evaluation of postural stability or visual function of healthy or injured Service members. The resulting project will yield an approach to assessment that is objective and quantitative and can be completed by corpsman and other providers in a relatively rapid manner (e.g., 20-30 minutes depending on final outcomes).

Public,318,Rehabilitation of Central Sensory Impairments for Balance in mTBI,FITBIR-STUDY0000318,"Other, specify","Objectives: Control of balance requires complex integration of sensory and motor systems. In the clinic or in the field, balance measurement is often over-simplified, preventing balance deficits from being identified and treated after mTBI. Our central hypothesis is that chronic balance deficits after mTBI result from impairments in central sensorimotor integration that may be helped by rehabilitation. There are two objectives of this proposal; the first objective is to characterize balance deficits in people with mTBI. The second objective is to use a novel ABF device to improve measures central sensorimotor integration and balance control. Plan: The proposed 4-year study has two parts: 1) Cross-sectional study (Aim I: Balance Assessment) to identify and characterize maladaptive balance control strategies after mTBI compared to healthy controls and 2) Interventional randomized pilot study (Aim II: Balance Rehabilitation) using a novel ABF rehabilitation technique to ameliorate maladaptive balance control strategies after TBI. Subjects in Aim II will be a subset from Aim I and studies will occur simultaneously. Methods: I) Balance Assessment: To characterize balance deficits in people with mTBI who have chronic, non-resolving balance deficits compared to healthy control subjects without a history of mTBI. We hypothesize that a) objective measures of central sensorimotor integration, static and dynamic balance will better distinguish people with mTBI from control subjects than clinical measures, b) a subset of people with mTBI will have abnormal CSMI test measures, even without peripheral vestibular or ocular motor deficits c) the relationship between poorer static/dynamic balance performance and mTBI is regulated/mediated by CSMI. We will test 130 subjects between the ages of 21 and 50; 65 with chronic (> 3 months) mTBI and non-resolving balance deficits and 65 healthy age and gender matched control subjects without a history of mTBI. We will obtain objective measures of static and dynamic balance using wearable inertial sensors and determine how these measures relate to central sensorimotor integration. We will also obtain laboratory measures of peripheral vestibular function and ocular motor function to help classify people and to consider as potential covariates in rehabilitation efficacy. II) Balance Rehabilitation: To determine the efficacy of a novel, ABF balance rehabilitation program to improve central sensorimotor integration, static and dynamic balance, and functional activity in patients with chronic mTBI. We hypothesize that a) CSMI scores will improve with rehabilitation and ABF will increase the improvement of CSMI scores beyond the standard of care, b) ABF intervention will improve objective summary measures of balance and c) people with central sensorimotor integration impairment will show sustained improvement in CSMI scores and balance after rehabilitation. We will randomize 40 subjects between the ages of 18 and 60; 65 with chronic (> 3 months) mTBI and non-resolving balance deficits from Aim I who have abnormal CSMI into either the ABF rehabilitation group or the standard of care group.

Public,323,A Magnetic Resonance Imaging Based Classifier to Accurately Diagnose Persistent Post-Traumatic Headache and to Differentiate it from Chronic Migraine,FITBIR-STUDY0000323,"Other, specify","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic headache (PTH) are common conditions that exert substantial impacts in the military and in the civilian population. TBI is a signature injury of U.S. Soldiers during modern warfare with 20% of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom Veterans having experienced TBI, 75% of which are mild TBI (mTBI). In addition, approximately 1.7 million American civilians seek medical attention each year for TBI and there are 1.6-3.8 million sports-related mTBIs annually. Headache is the most common symptom following mTBI, with estimates of headache prevalence following mTBI as high as 90%. PTH is often persistent (i.e., endures for >3 months following the injury), with about 66% of people with mTBI reporting continued headaches at 3 months post-injury. Although progress has been achieved in understanding PTH epidemiology, there are significant shortcomings in the description of PTH mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment. A major challenge for the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of PTH is the inability to accurately diagnose persistent post-traumatic headache (PPTH) attributed to mTBI and to reliably differentiate PPTH attributed to mTBI from chronic migraine (CM). Rationale: It is often impossible to clinically differentiate the patient who had an exacerbation of their underlying migraine pattern following TBI, from the patient who had a new onset of migraine following TBI, from the patient with true PPTH. According to International Classification of Headache Disorders diagnostic criteria, the only evidence for headache being attributable to a preceding head injury is that the headache begins within 7 days of the injury. However, a substantial proportion of military PTH starts after a longer interval (up to 60% of cases), the majority of PPTH is phenotypically indistinguishable from CM according to information typically collected in the clinical setting (60%-97%), and many Soldiers and civilians with presumed PPTH have a personal history of migraine preceding the mTBI. Thus, it is commonly challenging to differentiate PPTH from CM in the clinical setting. The inability to accurately diagnose PPTH attributed to mTBI and differentiate it from CM has substantial negative implications on patient care and the ability to conduct meaningful research on PPTH.Objective: The objective of this study is to use machine-learning algorithms to construct multivariate models of structural and functional imaging data and patient symptoms that accurately diagnose PPTH attributed to mTBI and differentiate it from CM.Study Design: Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and patient symptoms will be used to build and test automated diagnostic models that most accurately diagnose PPTH attributed to mTBI and differentiate it from CM. This investigation uses MRI sequences that could easily be employed during the clinical investigation of patients, without adding risk to the patient, without the need for contrast administration, and with little additional financial burden.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Todd  Schwedt', 'email': 'schwedt.todd@mayo.edu', 'orgName': 'Mayo Clinic and Foundation'}]","[{'siteName': 'Mayo Clinic and Foundation', 'address': '13400 E Shea Boulevard ', 'city': 'Scottsdale', 'state': 'AZ', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,[],[],['Clinical Assessment'],"Phenotyping: Contrast detailed symptom data from patients with PPTH attributed to mTBI and no history of preceding migraine to symptoms from CM patients with no history of head trauma.

Public,324,TBI Assessment of Readiness using a Gait Evaluation Test (TARGET):  Development of a Portable mTBI Screening Device,FITBIR-STUDY0000324,Natural History,"It is estimated that up to 320,000 service members in OEF/OIF have sustained some form of traumatic brain injury. The lack of an objective measurement tool for evaluation and monitoring of a suspected mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is of great concern to the military. Accurate diagnosis of an acute mTBI should involve detailed head injury history documentation and an assessment of a range of domains, including motor deficits. Assessments of motor functioning can detect neurophysiological impairments which may negatively impact the military personnel's ability to function in full military capacity. The NeuroCom Sensory Organization Test (SOT) is the current gold standard for assessing mTBI-related motor impairments; however, the equipment?s size and logistical footprint makes it impractical for field deployment. An objective and clinically valid, yet field deployable assessment of motor functioning would greatly assist military medical personnel with return to duty (RTD) decisions. The AccWalker smartphone app taps into accelerometry and orientation data in order to assess an individual's neuromotor functioning by focusing on movement variability. Clinical research shows increased movement variability emerges in motor tasks after a neurological insult. This is likely due to reduced capacity of the central nervous system (CNS) to control movement. Thus, variability in motor tasks such as walking, has been used to identify neurological impairment from mTBI. Gait tasks have been used to identify motor impairment following mTBI, however, a large overground space or a treadmill is needed to properly assess gait variability. In pursuit of a simple motor task that encompasses a movement variability profile comparable to gait behavior, we adopted a stepping-in-place task. Gait and stepping-in-place exhibit similar variability characteristics, making the stepping-in-place task a proxy for gait behavior. Therefore, the study will seek to assess the use of the AccWalker smartphone app during a stepping-in-place task as a means of screening for mTBI-related motor impairments.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Christopher Rhea', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'University of North Carolina at Greensboro'}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Jason P Coordinator/Lab Manager', 'email': 'jtjakiel@uncg.edu', 'orgName': ' '}]","[{'siteName': 'University of North Carolina at Greensboro', 'address': '1408 Walker Avenue', 'city': 'Greensboro', 'state': 'NC', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,[],[],['Clinical Assessment'],"The primary objectives of this effort will be to establish the: (1) reliability (both inter-rater and test-retest), (2) criterion validity (both concurrent and predictive), 3) reliable change estimates, and (4) diagnostic utility of the reliable change estimates.

The epidemiology of TBI in military and civilian populations is dominated by the least severe injuries, exposing the greatest number of individuals to potential risk for developing ADRC, yet most previous analysis studying the connection between TBI and ADRC do not include this category of injury severity. The most accurate and reliable study design to determine whether the occurrence of TBI increases risk for the development of ADRC is to identify incident TBI events by medical record review within a defined population and classify each by injury severity, identify matched referents within that same population, and follow both cohorts over time to observe incidence rates of ADRC.

Public,339,The Impact of Diffuse Mild Brain Injury on Clinical Outcomes in Children,FITBIR-STUDY0000339,Natural History,"There is no question that the vulnerabilities of the developing brain and the potential for recovery are unique, or that pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (pmTBI) represents a major public health concern with &#8776;400,000 new cases annually. Although the neurobehavioral symptoms of pmTBI are well-documented in the first days to weeks post-injury, few well-designed studies have examined the long-term consequences of injury. Even less is known about the neuropathology underlying the expression of post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and the impact on clinical outcomes. Thus, clinicians currently do not understand how children typically recover in the first year of injury from either a clinical or neurophysiologic perspective. The current application addresses this critical knowledge gap by collecting longitudinal (1 week, 4 months and 1 year post-injury) neuroimaging and clinical data on a large cohort of pmTBI patients (N = 150) and healthy controls (N = 125). Our preliminary data suggests diffuse white matter injuries, hemodynamic abnormalities in deep gray matter, and signs of cortical atrophy at 4 months post-injury in a relatively small sample. Consistent with animal models, these data indicate that multiple imaging measures at multiple time-points are needed to understand the dynamic effects of pmTBI on neurophysiology and underlying contributory factors (e.g., cerebral blood flow, cerebral vascular reactivity). The current study will extend these findings to the early chronic and chronic injury stages, determine how these diffuse injuries relate to clinical outcomes, and determine the individual ?recovery time-courses? of selected biomarkers. Ratings of PCS are collected from both child and parent in conjunction with computerized cognitive testing, quality of life measures, and assessments of pre-morbid functioning. A multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion imaging sequence provides unique information on potential underlying mechanisms of action (water fractions). Functional activity is measured during a spatial attention task and through connectivity analyses. Additional quantitative measurements of resting cerebral blood flow and cerebral vascular reactivity will disambiguate hemodynamic from neuronal dysfunction. These independent measures will also provide critical information on how the vasculature in deep gray matter structures is affected by trauma, providing mechanisms of target engagement for future therapeutic trials. Growth curve modeling provides preliminary analyses of different recovery trajectories (fully versus partially recovered) for both clinical and imaging data. The public health significance of the current application is multifold. First, late childhood and adolescence constitutes a critical time for brain development, and persistent neurobehavioral symptoms following pmTBI can interfere with subsequent academic achievements and interpersonal relationships for years post-injury. Second, developing objective biomarkers that track injury progression will aid in diagnosis of injury severity and provide an empirical foundation for determining when it is truly safe for children to return to learn/physical activity. Finally, understanding the mechanisms of injury represents a critical first step for developing novel therapies that target neuropathology (i.e. target engagement) rather than symptom mitigation, the current approach for all pmTBI therapies.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Andrew Mayer', 'email': 'amayer@mrn.org', 'orgName': ' '}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Nicholas Shaff', 'email': 'nshaff@mrn.org', 'orgName': ' '}]","[{'siteName': 'Mind Research Network', 'address': '1101 Yale Blvd NE', 'city': 'Albuquerque', 'state': 'NM', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD,[],[],"['Imaging', 'Clinical Assessment']",,2021-06-01,2026-12-31,120.0,,

Public,342,Diagnosing contributions of sensory and cognitive deficits to hearing dysfunction in blast-exposed/TBI Service Members,FITBIR-STUDY0000342,"Other, specify","Many Service Members returning from deployment complain of problems communicating in noisy settings, especially when they are trying to understand speech when there are competing sounds. However, when they go to the audiological clinic, they are often found to have ?normal hearing,? meaning that they can detect quiet sounds as easily as healthy young adults without hearing dysfunction. To date, the reasons for these kinds of hearing difficulties are not well understood, and, therefore, there is no evidence-based approach to treating such problems. Anecdotally, blast exposure, which many returning Service Members have suffered, seems to cause or exacerbate these kinds of complaints. An ongoing study of the prevalence of hearing dysfunction in Service Members at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) on the impact of hearing dysfunction on Fitness for Duty suggests that as many as 40% of Service Members deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan experienced high-intensity blasts, and that roughly 40% of these blast-exposed personnel show functional hearing deficits, despite having normal hearing thresholds?leading to the staggering suggestion that 15-20% of returning Service Members may fall into this category of listeners with ?normal hearing? who nonetheless have difficulty communicating in everyday environments.
The current project builds on emerging evidence that suggest that in listeners with ?normal? hearing, there are at least two quite distinct deficits that can contribute to problems understanding speech amidst competing sources, but through very different mechanisms. The first, a sensory deficit, is thought to arise from a loss in the number of auditory nerve fibers conveying sound from the cochlea to the brain. This ?auditory neuropathy,? which is now well documented in animals, does not always affect hearing thresholds, but degrades the fidelity with which auditory information is encoded. Auditory neuropathy is associated with noise exposure, which may explain why Service Members are particularly prone to experiencing difficulty. The second, a cortical deficit, is thought to arise from damage to cortical structures that are engaged when a listener is trying to focus attention on one sound and ignore competing sounds. This process of directing attention changes the information that the brain extracts from a scene, but depends on many different neural regions coordinating their activity in precise ways. Blast exposure experienced by Service Members is likely damaging parts of the brain (and connections between brain regions) that are critical for controlling this ?auditory selective attention,? thus leading to communication disorders.
The first and second goals of this project are to test Service Members who have clinically ?normal hearing? (based on current audiometric tests) to determine how both sensory and cortical deficits (respectively) contribute to their problems. The third goal is to develop rapid, reliable, and repeatable tests that can separately quantify sensory coding fidelity and the ability of an individual listener to cortically control selective auditory attention. Five to eight years from now, such tests could be in the clinic, revolutionizing how audiologists think about hearing function, and how they counsel their clients.
Results from the proposed study will build new understanding of the mechanisms that lead to hearing dysfunction that is currently ?invisible.? By uncovering the core deficiencies leading to difficulties communicating in noisy settings and developing robust diagnostic tests, new interventions and therapies may be developed that target specific deficits in individual patients. Results are likely to aid in the development of appropriate evaluations of auditory Fitness for Duty, ensuring more Service Members are operating effectively in their military roles.

Public,346,ADAPT Sub-study: MRI Markers of Functional Outcome after Severe Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000346,Natural History,"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and long-term disabilities in children, yet there remains a critical need for accurate markers of outcome in these patients. Identification of improved MRI markers of long-term neurocognitive outcome will improve clinical prognostication after an injury and help to direct and monitor rehabilitation strategies. Recent advances in neuroimaging have elucidated the existence of large-scale brain networks responsible for distinct cognitive and psychological functions. A network-based framework for TBI-induced cognitive dysfunction is a novel paradigm for investigating hypotheses regarding the relationship between patient-specific injury patterns and neurocognitive outcomes. Using this framework, this study will identify early imaging predictors of global and specific neuropsychological functions after severe pediatric TBI. In addition, the study will investigate the association between late MRI markers of brain network dysfunction and impairments in commonly affected cognitive domains (executive function, memory, and internalizing behavior). The project will leverage an ongoing, multi-center study of severe pediatric TBI to enable this large neuroimaging study with the following three aims: Aim 1: Test whether the severity and location of white and gray matter injuries identified on MRI early after injury independently predict functional and neurocognitive outcomes one year after severe pediatric TBI. Acute MRI scans will be assessed using standardized common data element (CDE) definitions, and MRI measures predictive of global and domain- specific cognitive outcomes will be determined. Aim 2: Test whether global or regional cerebral atrophy at one year post-injury is related to neurocognitive and behavioral impairments after TBI. Global and regional volumetrics will be determined from structural MRI scans, and correlated with neuropsychological testing measures of function in each cognitive domain. Aim 3: Test whether TBI-induced alterations in white matter microstructure and functional network connectivity are related to impairments in cognition and psychological functioning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rfMRI) will be used to investigate the relationship between damage to specific brain networks and neurocognitive function. Successful completion of this project will determine clinically useful MRI markers of neurocognitive outcome and will provide new information on the relationship between brain network dysfunction and cognitive impairments after TBI.

If we could understand the underpinnings behind this variation, then treatments could be optimized to reduce the profound negative societal and economic impact associated with pediatric TBI. Predictors of recovery following TBI, particularly the roles of genes and environment, are incompletely understood. Elucidation of genetic and environmental influences on recovery after pediatric TBI is critically needed to advance development of precision medicine strategies. Novel systems biology analyses conducted by our group indicate genetic factors within two main biologic processes, response to injury (cell proliferation, cell death, inflammatory response, cellular metabolism) and neurocognitive and behavioral reserve (neurodevelopment, cognition, and behavior), are likely associated with recovery after TBI. An approach that seeks to identify genes and variants over-represented (gene-enrichment) across these biologic processes would improve upon prior candidate gene approaches. Genetic variants implicated in recovery after TBI interact with home and family environmental factors to influence cognitive and behavioral outcomes in other pediatric populations; however, the effects of the interaction between genes and environment on recovery after pediatric TBI have not been explored. The objective of this proposal is to understand the interplay between genetically influenced biologic processes and environment with respect to recovery after pediatric TBI. We hypothesize that genetic variants overrepresented in biologic processes important to TBI recovery will be associated with global, neurocognitive, and neurobehavioral functioning and that environmental factors will interact with genetic factors to influence recovery after severe pediatric TBI. We will collect salivary DNA samples from approximately 338 children participating in the Approaches and Decisions in Acute Pediatric TBI Trial (ADAPT, U01 NS081041).

Public,354,Development of Unique Serum Biomarkers with mass Spectroscopy for Diagnosis of Veterans with Chronic Posttraumatic Headache Versus Idiopathic Chronic Migraine,FITBIR-STUDY0000354,"Other, specify: Other","Chronic migraine (CM) is a syndrome producing significant morbidity for the sufferer in terms of interfering with employment and career advancement, family relations/responsibilities, leisure activities and enjoyment of life, and has a course that may last for months to years. While this syndrome is described as a primary headache that may occur in 1-2 % of the population, the phenotype of CM is a common sequel of Deployment-related TBI (D-TBI) occurring in up to 40% of OEF/OIF Veterans with a D-TBI. Post-Traumatic CM (PT-CM) may continue unabated for 2-11 years after the TBI. The biochemical mechanism producing this recurrent headache, varying from 15 headache days per month to virtually continuous headache, is not understood. The hypothesis is that PT-CM and Idiopathic CM (I-CM) are related to ongoing neuro-inflammatory processes, possibly with neuro-degenerative and vascular components, that are producing unique biomolecules which are shed into the interstitial spaces and then cross the blood-brain barrier into the peripheral blood. This hypothesis further states that this study will be able to identify these different biomolecules and their mass profiles in the blood and determine if the CM syndromes they reflect are different or similar. This study will utilize the Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) technology, which is very simple, robust, and low-cost, to identify distinguish and monitor serum mass profiles for PT-CM, I-CM, and matched controls, and show differences as well as similarities in these serum mass profiles. Tandem MS/MS will then identify biomolecules and biomarkers unique to the TBI and I-CM conditions. These biomolecules and their profiles can provide clues to the biochemical mechanisms underlying PT-CM and I-CM, and may suggest possibilities for therapy. This is a translational project that will evaluate and compare serum mass profiles produces by the ESI-MS technology in four groups of subjects. These groups include: (a) Veterans of OEF/OIF who have suffered a D-TBI and subsequently manifest the syndrome of CM (PT-CM); (b) control subjects drawn from OEF/OIF Veterans who are matched to the PT-CM subjects by age sex , race and time of deployment; (c) Veterans with CM who did not have a D-TBI and who developed idiopathic CM during or after deployment; and (d) control subjects drawn from veterans who do not have headaches more than 1/month and who have not had a D-TBI who will be matched to the subjects in group c by age, sex and race.

Research Plan: Comprehensive evaluation of epilepsy in Military and Veteran populations should: 1) incorporate both DoD and VA data in a longitudinal record, if possible; 2) include primary data collection including lifetime history of TBI and patient reported outcomes for a sample of the population; and 3) include imaging and neuropsychological evaluations for a small subset of the sample for whom lifetime TBI status is known. Methods: In Aim 1, we will identify a cohort of all Post-9/11 Veterans who receive VA Care (2 or more years 2002-2015), obtain VA and DoD health care system data for that cohort, and identify epilepsy and TBI over the longitudinal data record. Using those data we will examine the relationship between TBI severity (with emphasis on mTBI) and epilepsy. From that cohort we will select a sub-sample of Veterans based on mTBI and epilepsy status, conduct telephone interviews to identify lifetime TBI exposure (including mechanisms of exposure), seizure history and functional status related to work, and physical, mental health and social functioning. We will use these data in Aim 2 to determine if deployment related mTBI exposure is associated with epilepsy after controlling for greatest lifetime TBI severity, and if blast-related TBI (BR-TBI)/multiple mTBI are associated with increased odds of epilepsy compared to non- BR-TBI. In Aim 3, we will compare self-reported work, physical, mental health and social functional status in a stratified random sample of veterans with epilepsy to controls without epilepsy.

To our best knowledge, no cure has been developed for photophobia to date, as the underlying cause(s) have not been understood. Thus, an effective cure or permanent symptomatic relief will be an invaluable help to those that suffer from photophobia. We expect that there will be substantial long-term beneficial effects from treatments based on the output of our studies to identify the mechanism of photophobia. We hypothesize that one of two mechanisms ? independently or jointly - are primarily responsible for the symptoms of photophobia. The first mechanism we propose to test is that a special type of retinal cells, the melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs), which project to the brainstem, and/or their pathway, are damaged in TBI. These cells respond to very specific wavelengths of light, so by careful choice of stimuli we can selectively activate their pathway. The second mechanism, which we will investigate is the tissue swelling from concussive injury that develops in core brain structures, such as the brainstem. To investigate these two mechanisms, we propose to test two groups of subjects who have experienced concussion; one group with photophobia or light-induced pain symptoms, the second group without these symptoms. We will use a suite of visual diagnostic techniques to determine the differences between these two groups. Finding systematic differences between these two groups will help us to define the mechanisms associated with photophobia. 1. We will measure electrical activity of the eye to determine if there is functional damage to the retina and its mRGCs by electroretinography (ERG); 2. We will record electrical activity from the scalp to determine if different cortical areas are affected by changes in mRGC function using high-density electroencephalography (EEG); 3. We will record changes in the blood oxygenation-level dependent signal in MRI scans of the brain to determine changes in core brain function (functional MRI); 4. We will measure the volume and shape of deep brain structures to determine if there are changes due to tissue swelling using the structural MRI technique of tensor-based morphometry (TBM).",Completed,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Lora Likova, Ph.D.', 'email': 'lora@ski.org', 'orgName': 'SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INST'}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Spero Nicholas', 'email': 'spero@ski.org', 'orgName': 'SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INST SAN FRANCISCO CA'}]","[{'siteName': 'Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute', 'address': '2318 Fillmore Street', 'city': 'San Francisco', 'state': 'CA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,"['EEG', 'mRGCs', 'photophobia', 'mTBI']",[],"['Imaging', 'Clinical Assessment']",,2014-09-30,2017-09-30,,10.23718/FITBIR/1518824,
Public,366,The role of inflammation in development of Alzheimer's disease following repetitive head trauma,FITBIR-STUDY0000366,"Other, specify","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) promotes several Alzheimer?s disease (AD)-like pathological features including accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) within neurons; however, genetic risk factors that link TBI and MAPT pathology remain unclear. Two studies in late 2012, demonstrated that heterozygous rare variants in the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene were associated with late-onset AD and multiple subsequent studies have confirmed the role of TREM2 in dementia. For example, homozygous loss of function mutations in TREM2 have been associated with a recessive form of early onset dementia and similar mutations in TREM2 have been associated with, frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson?s disease. Notably, TREM2 is selectively expressed by microglia and monocytes and has been shown to promote phagocytosis as well as dampen inflammatory cytokine production. To date no studies have examined the role of TREM2 in TBI, the relationship between TBI, TREM2 and AD or the role of TREM2 in monocytes and microglia following TBI. Given the importance of TREM2 in the inflammatory response as well as its association with dementia, genetic variations in TREM2 represent an ideal target for studies aiming to characterize the association between TBI and AD.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Nipun Chopra', 'email': 'chopran@iupui.edu', 'orgName': 'INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Bruce T Lamb', 'email': 'btlamb@iu.edu', 'orgName': 'INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS'}]","[{'siteName': 'Indiana University', 'address': '107 S Indiana Avenue', 'city': 'Bloomington', 'state': 'ID', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,[],[],[],"we will collect blood from active professional fighters and age/education-matched controls to examine expression of acute post-injury inflammatory markers via flow cytometry and multiplex gene expression assays focusing on macrophages.

In addition, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid imaging will be completed in a subset of participants to document anatomical changes and presence of A-beta, respectively. Finally, in Specific Aim 2, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be collected from a subset of participants to examine expression of inflammatory markers correlated with AD. These studies directly leverage an ongoing study examining similar inflammatory markers and molecules in a study of experimental TBI from both wild-type and Trem2 knockout mice, allowing us for the first time to directly compare results across experimental TBI and well-characterized human TBI.Relevance/Impact: These studies will develop novel resources and models to identify potential genetic factors regulating the TBIAD connection as well as inflammatory pathways that may impact TBI induced AD-like pathology and neurodegeneration.

Public,368,Rapid Isolation and Detection of RNA Biomarkers for TBI Diagnostics,FITBIR-STUDY0000368,Epidemiology,"The rapid detection, diagnosis, and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) at the point-of-care presents an ongoing capability gap. A soldier may sustain a TBI, but due to deployment and combat factors, access to appropriate diagnostic care at the time and location of the event may be impeded or impossible. TBI is also a major health issue in the civilian population with over 1.5 million persons experiencing a TBI annually in the USA. About 50,000 patients die from TBI, and another 500,000 are hospitalized. Many researchers are now exploring blood-based RNA and proteins as potential biomarkers for TBI. Increased baseline serum levels of S100B, GFAP, NSE and tau have all been associated with a poor TBI prognosis. To this end, the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC), and Raytheon are proposing a rapid, economical approach for the detection of TBI. This approach leverages an enabling new device and technology to allow the low-cost isolation of circulating cell free (ccf) RNA and proteins, and detection and identification of the specific RNA biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of TBI. Recent research has revealed that organ trauma promotes the appearance of both ccf-DNA and ccf-RNA in the form of nanoparticulates and exosomes which are released into the blood stream. Significantly, ccf-RNA which has a high potential for containing both organ specific and trauma related RNA biomarkers can be used to identify the traumatized organ from which it originates. Presently, UCSD is refining a novel method, called High Conductance Dielectrophoresis (HC-DEP), based on a microelectrode array device that rapidly processes blood samples to localize and concentrate even trace amounts of ccf-RNA and ccf-DNA. Therefore, highly sensitive detection of trauma to the specifically identifiable organ can now be achieved and monitored in a short time at low cost.",,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Jean Lewis', 'email': 'jeanlewis@ucsd.edu', 'orgName': 'Department of Defense'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Michael J Heller, Ph.D.', 'email': 'hellerm@ohsu.edu', 'orgName': 'UC San Diego, Department of Nanoengineering'}]","[{'siteName': 'UC San Diego, Nanoengineering Department ', 'address': '9500 Gilman Drive', 'city': 'La Jolla', 'state': 'CA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,"['Veterans', 'BiologicalMarkers', 'Point-of-CareSystems', 'RNA', 'TBI']",[],['Genomics'],"First Specific Aim and Tasks (Year 1) ?

Study subjects will be consecutive admissions of adults with severe TBI meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adults, ages 18-55 years, hospitalized at Memorial Hermann Hospital for severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Score 3-8) will be screened for eligibility regardless of gender, race and ethnicity, according to the selection criteria. The eligibility criteria will be used by project personnel in reviewing medical charts of prospective patients. Patients will be randomized to receive a single IV infusion of BMMNs (6 x 106 or 9 x 106) or placebo. After undergoing the bone marrow harvest or sham harvest procedure, the subject will receive the IV infusion of either the BMMNCs or placebo. Subjects will be monitored per standard of care for TBI and safety data collected throughout the harvest/infusion procedures. Safety data will be collected daily through post-infusion day 14, at hospital discharge, and at the 1 and 6 month follow-up study visits, or more frequently if infusion related adverse events are suspected. Cerebrospinal fluid (if available), and plasma will be collected for pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine?s, the biomarker ceruloplasmin, and CSF ratios of albumin following consent (baseline), and every twelve hours (+/- 2 hours) post-infusion for 3 days, once on post-infusion days 4 and 5, and at the 1 and 6 month follow-up study visits. A spleen ultrasound will be obtained following consent and on post-infusion days 1-7, and at all follow-up visits.

Public,372,Quantitative Evaluation of Visual and Auditory Dysfunction and Multi-Sensory Integration in Complex TBI Patients,FITBIR-STUDY0000372,Clinical Trial,"The majority of mild TBI patients report self-described sensory dysfunction and yet they often pass standard eye and hearing exams. Further, the 80% of TBI patients diagnosed as mild TBI appear normal on a standard CT or MRI scan. There is an inherent variability of trauma; no trauma cases are exactly alike. This variability in combination with the lack of apparent damage in mild TBI patients has made diagnosis of these patients challenging. The lack of an objective, quantitative clinical metric for these changes in sensory function also prevents the initiation of clinical trials. Furthermore, it highlights the lack of understanding of the underlying cause of sensory dysfunction. Without an understanding of mechanism, rational therapies cannot be developed. The goals of this study are to identify sensitive, objective, quantitative tests to serve as diagnostics, to identify outcome measures for sensory dysfunction in TBI patients, and to better understand the physiological basis of sensory dysfunction. We propose that by assessing TBI patients in a Level 1 Trauma Center, two Veterans Administration Hospitals, and a military base housing a satellite of the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, we will recruit sufficient numbers of subjects to definitively identify assessments that are sensitive and specific enough to diagnose sensory dysfunction in complex TBI patients. We hypothesize that combining objective structural and functional assessments in the same subjects is more likely to overcome the inherent variability of trauma and yield useful diagnostic metrics than would each test separately.

Public,374,Patterns of Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Secondary to Blast Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000374,"Other, specify","Blast injuries are deemed signature wounds of recent wars; 12%-23% of returning Service members report traumatic brain injury (TBI), the majority mild TBI (mTBI). Of military personnel exposed to explosions, up to 77% sustain permanent hearing loss and 60%-75% report tinnitus. Patients with blast-related TBI are at least 2.5 times more likely to sustain tinnitus than patients with non-blast TBI. Despite the high prevalence of tinnitus, it remains a subjective syndrome that is not well characterized and for which there is no definitive treatment. This application makes use of the applied (human) TBI-related research Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs request for proposals to focus upon the area of hearing loss/dysfunction and tinnitus, with the prime goal being to better understand underlying neural mechanisms of tinnitus.Objective/Hypotheses: As a primary objective of the study, we propose to obtain Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) audiology exam data, administer (via telephone and internet) an interview and questionnaires (Objective 1). We hypothesize that: (1.1) deployment-related TBI will increase likelihood of post-deployment hearing loss, defined as a ""notch"" at 6000 Hz; (1.2) hearing loss will increase as a function of injury etiology (i.e., blast vs. non-blast) (Aim 1); and (2.1) deployment-related TBI (versus no TBI) will be associated with greater tinnitus symptom severity controlling for relevant variables (i.e., prior noise exposure, hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] status); (2.2) current tinnitus severity will vary as a function of injury etiology (Aim 2). As a second objective, we propose to invite four groups of participants to San Diego for comprehensive assessments including Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) scans to better understand underlying brain mechanisms (Objective 2).

Hypo-activity in high frequency bands from vmPFC will also correlate with PTSD symptoms; (3.4) Abnormal MEG resting-state signals and evoked responses from auditory cortices in STG as well as PFC will correlate with tinnitus symptom scores, behavioral deficits, and audiology data including tinnitus pitch, severity matching, and tinnitus masking scores (Aim 3).",Enrolling By Invitation,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Andrew Delarosa', 'email': 'asdelaro@ucsd.edu', 'orgName': 'VA San Diego Healthcare System'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Dewleen G Baker', 'email': 'dgbaker@ucsd.edu', 'orgName': 'VA San Diego Healthcare System'}]","[{'siteName': 'VA San Diego Healthcare System', 'address': '3350 La Jolla Village DR, MC 151', 'city': 'San Diego', 'state': 'CA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,"['DoD', 'TBI', 'PTSD', 'FunctionalImaging', 'Tinnitus', 'sensory', 'Auditoryarea', 'auditory', 'Veterans', 'trauma', 'blast', 'hearing impairment', 'ObservationalStudy', 'traumatic', 'injury', 'Beckdepressioninventory']",[],['Clinical Assessment'],"Aim 1: To test the effects of blast-related TBI on hearing loss.

Pharmacological treatments for pain elevate risk of opioid abuse, and research suggests veterans perceive barriers to existing non-pharmacological, clinic-based treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop pain management approaches that are effective, overcome barriers to care, and are readily usable by Veterans. Evidence suggests that neuromodulatory treatments, grounded in understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms of pain, reduce pain-related symptoms and have the potential to be developed into self-directed treatments through use of mobile technology.

The brain is unable to effectively synthesize omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, which in large part, have to be transported into the brain from blood. The literature suggests that these PUFA play a critical role in promoting neuronal repair and controlling the inflammatory milieu after TBI. Our preliminary data already provide compelling evidence that blood levels of PUFA containing lipids are altered in subjects with TBI in an APOE genotype dependent manner. While PL make up a large proportion of the blood lipid pool, there are other highly abundant lipids, such as CE and TG and mitochondrial specific lipids, such as acylcarnitine that also contain these omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA. A number of these lipids are packaged in lipoprotein-apoE complexes and once they reach the BBB, they are reprocessed for delivery into the brain via specific transporters (i.e. CD36, fatty acid translocase etc.). As such, it is possible that an examination of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA within plasma lipid classes along with APOE genotype could provide an indirect estimate of their impact on the brain after TBI.

Public,380,Novel Noninvasive Methods of Intracranial Pressure Assessment: Seeing the Brain Through the Eyes,FITBIR-STUDY0000380,"Other, specify: Other","Background: Care of moderate to severe combat-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to pose enormous challenges sometimes compounded by the need to provide prolonged field care (PFC). TBI in the presence of other injuries requiring prolonged damage control resuscitation (pDCR) provides additional challenges. The austere, resource-constrained combat environment and lack of readily available diagnostic capabilities often lead to delayed recognition of the severity of TBIs, resulting in exacerbated damage and increased TBI-related disabilities. Cerebrovascular autoregulation (CAR) and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring has been used in cases of civilian TBI-related injuries to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow to prevent secondary injury. However, technologies currently available to monitor CAR and ICP require invasive techniques and a high level of experience, while providing intermittent readings, making them impractical and unavailable in PFC and pDCR settings. Robust methods of noninvasive monitoring of CAR and ICP would allow for early application by combat medics, first responders, emergency departments, surgeons, and critical care staff. Improvement in screening and monitoring methods will provide a significant advantage and will equip combat medics with the tools necessary for earlier detection of life-threatening TBI and informed decisions regarding patient management. The proposed project aims to utilize ocular bioimpedance and ultrasound in a novel manner to assess CAR and ICP, utilizing the eye as a window to the brain.

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that ocular bioimpedance will track changes in cerebral blood volume and predict CAR impairment in a noninvasive and continuous manner, while ultrasound-assessment of ONSD using automated image analysis will enable an accurate noninvasive estimation of ICP.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Carmen  Colmenero Mahmood', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'University of Michigan', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Hakam Tiba', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'University of Michigan', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'University of Michigan', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],['W81XWH1810005'],DoD-Other,[],[],"['Imaging', 'Clinical Assessment']","1.

Public,381,Sensory Integration Balance Deficits in Complex mTBI: Can Early Initiation of Rehabilitation with Wearable Sensor Technology Improve Outcomes?,FITBIR-STUDY0000381,Clinical Trial,"Every year 1.7 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the US and of these, 84% are considered mild TBI (mTBI). Although imbalance is one of the most common and debilitating complaints after mTBI, we currently lack clear guidelines on when to initiate rehabilitation and it is unclear if early physical therapy is beneficial. Additionally, while wearable sensor data is not currently used in the clinic to assess or treat balance after mTBI, such technology may improve outcomes. Our research aligns directly with focus areas in JPC-8/CRMRP since we will study people with mTBI who also have complex, multisensory system impairments and complaints of imbalance. This call encourages studies of patients with dizziness and visual dysfunction that are slow to respond to current treatments. Our project also aligns with FY 16 PH/TBIRP CTRRA areas of encouragement for ‘interventional studies to evaluate emerging or existing rehabilitation strategies for the treatment of patients with complex TBI compared to existing standards of care.’ Our Phase 2 interventional study also addresses the interest in comorbidities (i.e. central sensory integration and/or peripheral vestibular dysfunction) that may be refractory to treatment. Our project includes a multidisciplinary team with an academic institution Oregon Health & Science university (OHSU) partnering with industry (APDM) in an effort to improve rehabilitation after mTBI. Our central hypothesis is that rehabilitation after mTBI is suboptimal due to late initiation of and inadequate performance of exercises that do not adequately challenge vestibular and sensory integration function. Our preliminary results show physical rehabilitation is initiated late (approximately 70 days post injury) and that individuals with mTBI have altered central sensorimotor integration and do not optimally perform balance exercises. We believe that wearable sensor technology could facilitate rehabilitation by monitoring the compliance and quality of balance exercises. There are 3 Aims of this proposal; Aim I. Early Intervention: To determine the effects of early vs late (standard of care) rehabilitation for balance deficits in mTBI; Aim II. Home Monitoring: To compare traditional balance rehabilitation versus balance rehabilitation with sensor-based home monitoring of the compliance and quality of prescribed exercises; Aim III.

Preclinical and clinical investigations indicate that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has a positive  impact on reducing brain injury and improving outcomes in severe TBI. By markedly increasing oxygen (O2) delivery to the traumatized brain, HBO can reverse the lack of O2 that precipitates cellular energy failure and subsequent brain cell death. However, prior to a formal phase III definitive efficacy study, important information is required regarding optimizing the HBO treatment schedule to be instituted in terms of pressure, frequency and other parameters. The lungs in severe TBI subjects have frequently been compromised by direct lung injury and/or acquired ventilator pneumonia and are susceptible to O2 toxicity.

Successful completion of our work on fTPI should provide to the military a device for use in the field to help assess the vulnerability of their soldiers to further head injury as well as for tracking the treatment of soldiers with mTBI/concussion. The second focus area is the Combat Casualty Care Research Program (CCCRP), specifically their emphasis on identification and development of medical devices for assessing, triaging and monitoring during early intervention in life-threatening battle injuries, here head trauma. Consistent with the mission of CCCRP we seek to refine and finalize our promising diagnostic methodology for observing aberrant brain structure via structural tissue pulsatility imaging (sTPI) with an eye on military constraints, specifically, its field-portable nature.

Until now, however, there have been no methods for monitoring heterogeneous pathomechanisms to identify patients for appropriate neuroprotection therapies. Using invasive monitoring in TBI patients requiring craniotomy, we have documented that spreading depolarizations (SD), a seizure-like pathology of cerebral gray matter that has been well-characterized through 60 years of research in animal models, are the dominant pathophysiologic process in peri-lesion cortex of many, but not all, severe TBI patients. Furthermore, we found that the occurrence of SD as a secondary injury process in patients is an independent predictor of worse neurologic outcomes. Thus, monitoring of SD provides the first real-time measure of neuronal secondary injury processes in patients to determine the selective application and benefit of neuroprotective therapies. However, since surgical patients are <10% of all TBI, less invasive and non-invasive techniques for SD monitoring are now required to generalize these findings.

Public,390,Objective dual-task turning measures for return-to-duty assessments,FITBIR-STUDY0000390,Clinical Trial,"Objective and Rationale: Determining readiness for duty after concussion is essential for the safety of soldiers and their units. Currently, these decisions are primarily based on how soldiers feel and through the testing of their sensation, movement or thought processes, or physical tests of balance that may not reflect the types of activities that are common for service members. Recent progress in using wearable sensors that can be worn during daily activities now allow more accurate measurements of service members’ motions. Our long-term objective is to improve service members’ readiness for combat and quality of life by improving testing and treatment after concussion.
What types of patients will it help and how will it help them? Over 305,000 service members have sustained a concussion over the last 16 years, and over 1 million civilians sustain concussions annually. This study seeks to improve the accuracy of diagnosing post-concussion movement problems and to provide better tests to determine when service members may be cleared to return to duty. To do this, we will use body worn sensors to test if the measurement of complex turning activities performed at the same time as thinking about something else (cognition) are better tests to measure improvement following treatment and as tools to determine if a service member is ready to return to duty. Based on previous research, we believe that measuring turning while thinking about something else will be better than the currently used tests in people after concussion because it more accurately reflects the demands of everyday function. We believe that this testing will be better at detecting problems than if sensation, balance, movement, and thinking were tested alone. In service members with concussion, lasting problems, even when seemingly mild, can have severe consequences. The ability to move under fire and to react with balance and skilled movements are critical components for the service member’s, and their unit’s survival. Additionally, the unit’s mission readiness depends on the health of every service member; withholding a service member from duty requires convincing evidence that they pose a risk to themselves or their unit.
What are the potential clinical applications? To test our belief that turning measures will improve our ability to make accurate clinical decisions about concussion and return to duty, we will recruit participants with concussion symptoms that are have not gone away, healthy civilian subjects, and healthy active duty soldiers. As a final test, we will recruit soldiers referred to military rehabilitation centers for balance treatment following concussion. By performing this study at varied sites around the United States, we will improve the usefulness of measures of turning in both civilian and individuals on active military duty. The large number of people tested at the 6 sites will allow for the findings to be adopted into military and civilian concussion treatment settings and will benefit clinicians and patients through more accurate testing of symptoms.
What is the projected time line? To achieve the objectives outlined in this study, we have planned to take 4 years to test the number of people that we hope to recruit.
What is the likely contribution of the proposed research project to advance the field of complex mTBI? This project will advance the field of complex concussion by documenting that tests using sensors worn on the body will improve our ability to diagnose movement problems after concussion and improve the ability to evaluate improvement after rehabilitation. We will make our findings easily available to the public so other centers can also adopt the testing we find is most useful for return to duty assessment following concussion.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Laurie King', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'OHSU', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Joshua Koch', 'email': 'kochjo@ohsu.edu', 'orgName': 'Oregon Health Science University '}]","[{'siteName': 'Oregon Health & Science University', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD,[],[],['Clinical Assessment'],,2018-09-01,2022-09-30,,,1669210.0
Public,391,Telephone Delivery of Cognitively Augmented Behavioral Activation (Tele-CABA) for Veterans,FITBIR-STUDY0000391,Clinical Trial,"Objectives: The primary objective of the Telephone Delivery of Cognitively Augmented Behavioral Activation (Tele-CABA) intervention with Veterans who have a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is to reduce their negative cognitive and psychiatric health outcomes and promote personal resilience. The long-term objective of this study is to develop an accessible and acceptable intervention that can be broadly disseminated to address the complex rehabilitation needs within this population of Veterans.

Plan: This study capitalizes on the resources and scientific and clinical expertise available at the VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) Neuropsychology Clinic and the VA Rehabilitation Research &
Development (RR&D) funded National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR). Participants will be Veterans and Service members with a history of TBI enrolled for health services at any VA medical center
or satellite program. A total of 192 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment (Tele-CABA) or a usual-care control group (UC).

Methods: Participants randomly assigned to the Tele-CABA group will receive the manualized intervention delivered by telephone over the course of 10 weekly, 60-minute sessions. Participants in the UC group will continue to receive their regular medical, psychiatric, and psychotherapeutic care. All participants will undergo evaluation at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-months following the completion of treatment. At baseline, participants will complete a diagnostic TBI interview, self-report questionnaires measuring cognitive and psychiatric symptom severity including the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) and a brief cognitive screening battery. Self-report questionnaires and cognitive testing will be repeated at post-treatment and
follow-up. We will evaluate the following primary outcomes: cognitive symptoms, psychiatric distress symptoms, utility of compensatory strategies, self-efficacy, adaptive functioning, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction.

Relevance to VA’s Mission: TBI is a significant cause of disability with long-term physical, cognitive, and mental health consequences. Interventions designed to address the complex needs of Veterans with TBI are necessary to improve recovery and community reintegration. Few interventions exist, and even fewer provide access for Veterans who are unwilling or unable to obtain services in urban outpatient settings. Once established, the Tele-CABA intervention could be disseminated nationally and provided during deployments to active duty Service members and Veterans, resulting in more immediate care.

Public,394,Imaging Effects of Head Impact Exposure During Contact Sport,FITBIR-STUDY0000394,Natural History,"As sport-related concussion (SRC) remains a significant health problem, there is growing concern that even repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure while playing contact sports (CS) may lead to a variety of worrisome outcomes, including neurobehavioral problems and long-term cognitive deficits. Although the number of head impacts per athlete in CS such as football can be very high, there are typically relatively few diagnosed concussions in a career. This fuels the worry that RHI may have cumulative effects on brain structure and function. An increasing realization is that brain injury is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon (e.g., presence or absence of concussion) but may also result from accumulated head impact. While the concept “subconcussive” is yet to be clearly defined, athletes who receive non-concussive blows are unlikely to undergo clinical assessment and will continue to play, exposing their compromised brains to further injury. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that RHI over even a single season in college or high school football players might be associated with measurable neurocognitive and neurophysiologic deficits without concussion. However, studies of RHI during routine CS exposure are still scarce. Findings from existing neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies are inconclusive and contradictory. To date, no clear link between the biomechanical dose of RHI exposure and their short- and long-term effects on the brain has been established. The extent to which RHI exposure differentially affects the developing brain remains unknown. A firm understanding of this problem is critical, because the accurate estimation of effects of the accumulation of RHI on brain structure and function could allow for the protection of young athletes.
The overarching goal of this research is to combine state-of-art neuroimaging and biomechanical metrics to identify key neurophysiological processes in young athletes associated with RHI exposure during routine CS. Based on our promising preliminary work and existing data, our central hypothesis is that RHI exposure during routine CS are related to abnormalities of underlying neurophysiological state, including alterations of functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and potential microstructural damage. This study introduces a novel metric: functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM) using advanced multiband functional MRI (fMRI). Specifically, FCDM enables simultaneous evaluation of the local and global functional connectivity, that is very suitable to assess functional abnormalities caused by RHI exposure on the developing brain. To fully evaluate brain function and neurophysiological status, we will combine FCDM with CBF measured using a 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) technique. To characterize potential microstructural damage, we will apply advanced multi-shell diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Moreover, the quantification of recurring head impacts during routine CS seasons will be assessed using a state-of-art head impact monitoring mouthguard (IMM) system. The novel biomechanical cumulative metric based on the magnitude and frequency of head impact during each season will be employed. This prospective longitudinal study will include athletes in two age groups (middle school and high school) of two highly popular CS (football and soccer) in comparison to demographic closely matched noncontact sports (NCS) players.

Impact: This grant application for the first study investigating mechanisms of PNES and PTE will provide increased understanding of neural circuitry in PTE and PNES, which can inform PTE and PNES treatments and could change clinical neurologic and psychiatric practice for PTE and PNES.",Completed,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'William C LaFrance', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'DoD', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Krista Tocco', 'email': 'KTocco@lifespan.org', 'orgName': 'DoD'}, {'role': 'Researcher', 'fullName': 'Adam Goodman', 'email': 'amgood@uab.edu', 'orgName': 'DoD', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Jerzy Szaflarski', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'DoD', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Grayson  Baird', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'DoD', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'Providence VA Medical Center', 'address': '830 Chalkstone Ave', 'city': 'Providence', 'state': 'RI', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}, {'siteName': 'Rhode Island Hospital ', 'address': '593 Eddy Street', 'city': 'Providence', 'state': 'RI', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}, {'siteName': 'The University of Alabama at Birmingham', 'address': '1719 6th Ave. South ', 'city': 'Birmingham', 'state': 'AL', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}]",[],[],DoD-MRDC,[],[],"['Imaging', 'Clinical Assessment']","Specific Aim 1: To compare neural correlates of response to fMRI stimuli before and after cognitive challenge (CBT-Sz).

Public,400,Precision Intracranial Bleed Triage and Monitoring (CT+),FITBIR-STUDY0000400,Clinical Trial,"The clinical foundation of this study is based on the importance of cerebral hemodynamics in the diagnosis and management of TBI. Deficits in cerebral hemodynamics following a severe TBI are well established and recently have been shown to be affected in mild TBI as well. Recent research interest in mild TBI or concussion driven by both increased military and civilian awareness and has focused on non-invasive assessments of cerebral hemodynamics including specific sequences of MRI (functional MRI (fMRI), arterial spin labeling (ASL)), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), PET, and perfusion CT.

Studies have supported the use of TCD in the ER and pre-hospital setting for prognosis / detection of deterioration of all severities of TBI. For mild and moderate TBI in the ED, both Jaffres et al. (Jaffres et al., 2005) and Bouzat et al.(Bouzat et al., 2011) investigated the use traditional TCD features for prognostic purposes. Jaffres showed that PI was able to broadly differentiate patients who had deteriorated from those who did not. Bouzat later confirmed these results and reported 89% overall accuracy in identifying patients who would deteriorate.

Despite these positive results for TBI, recommendations by DoD, established clinical use (reimbursement, guidelines, etc.), and technical advantages (portable, non-invasive, and inexpensive) TCD has not gained widespread adoption because of specific limitations. These limitations include the requirement of an expert technician and limited data utilization. Neural Analytics is developing a platform that addresses these limitations and extends the use of traditional TCD ultrasound.

This project will compare the diagnostic prediction capability of a transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) based machine learning analysis platform to CT imaging of subjects with moderate and severe TBI. Additionally, the feasibility to collect TCD data using an automated headset platform for military use will be demonstrated.

Public,401,A Prospective Non-Invasive Study of Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity Morphology for Quantification of Intracranial Pressure (ICP),FITBIR-STUDY0000401,Clinical Trial,"TBI severity in the context of a closed head injury can be difficult to diagnose. There is a need for rapid triage of closed head injuries to identify the requirement for a higher level of care as well as monitor for a worsening condition in the field. A field medic has limited capability and may currently only be able to use subjective symptomatic or clinical signs which are often inaccurate and cannot assess complications such as life threatening increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) or other severe cerebral hemodynamic impairments.

Clinically, ICP is a fundamental physiologic parameter that, if elevated, can lead to a pathological reduction in cerebral blood flow and possible herniation of the brain, resulting in irreversible brain damage or death if left untreated. Current state-of-the-art assessment of non-penetrating TBI is limited to advanced imaging (CT and MRI), invasive monitoring devices (i.e. invasive ICP monitors), or ineffective clinical tools that lack accuracy, are not portable, have long assessment time, or do not have a direct physiological basis. Furthermore, many of these technologies require highly trained specialists to administer and interpret, resulting in a critical need for a comprehensive diagnostic and assessment technology for TBI.

Previous work has shown that life threatening ICP elevation after TBI can be diagnosed with a portable and non-invasive transcranial Doppler (TCD) system.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long been known to be a leading cause of death and disability among children and young adults. However, it has only recently been argued that concussion, a form of ?mild? TBI, increases the risk for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of concussion is crucial for injury diagnosis and prevention. However, past research efforts have been unable to identify a clear link between head impact acceleration dose and neurological response indicative of injury. This is mainly due to the lack of a large, high quality concussion dataset. The difficulty in measuring rare injury scenarios has hampered individual investigators from making substantial progress. Thus the required dataset can only be gathered through large- scale, multi-institution dissemination of a validated head impact measurement sensor. We propose to widely disseminate our rigorously validated Stanford mouthguard (MiG2.0), and subsequently develop a platform to share collected data among many investigators. The MiG2.0 is a unique design that rigidly couples to the skull through upper dentition. This project will disseminate the MiG2.0 to a large community of concussion researchers that study high injury rate populations such as contact sports players. At the end of the project, we will have a large concussion database with accurate head impact measurements that will further our understanding of concussion mechanisms. Our long-term goal is that the knowledge gained from this dissemination effort will improve concussion management and long-term brain health by enabling (1) real-time field diagnosis, and (2) design improvements in protective equipment for athletics, the military, transportation and other high-risk activities.",2013-12-21,2013-12-22,,,
Public,404,"Personalized, Augmented Cognitive Training (PACT) for Service Members and Veterans with a History of TBI",FITBIR-STUDY0000404,Clinical Trial,"Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common medical condition that occurs when a head injury causes someone to lose consciousness, feel dazed or confused, or be unable to remember events occurring immediately after the injury. While most individuals with mild TBI recover within weeks or months, some individuals with mild TBI report chronic symptoms such as difficulty with cognitive skills like attention, learning, or memory, along with other symptoms such as irritability or headache. Previous studies, including those conducted by our scientific team, have shown that cognitive rehabilitation can help patients with persistent symptoms after mild TBI return to full duty, work, school, and other important life activities. Specifically, cognitive rehabilitation can provide lasting improvements in thinking abilities, functional capacity, post-concussive symptoms, and quality of life after mild TBI. However, effective interventions are still out of reach for many service members and Veterans with TBI. For patients who have returned to duty, employment, or education, scheduling up to 60 hours of treatment (a typical treatment schedule in many settings) may not be feasible. Additionally, some patients may live in areas where it is burdensome to make numerous visits to a medical center. In response to these needs, our team has created a new treatment, Personalized Augmented Cognitive Training (PACT). PACT compresses treatment into six hours of once-weekly personalized, one-on-one training by selecting treatment modules based on patient needs and priorities—substantially reducing the total amount of time required to complete treatment. PACT can be offered either in-person (in clinic) or via home-based video telemedicine (i.e., Skype), depending upon patients’ preferences. Additionally, PACT includes training and encouragement for service members and Veterans to make self-directed use of mobile apps that train cognitive skills and strategies. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate whether PACT is effective at improving cognition, symptoms, and functional outcomes among military service members and Veterans with a history of mild TBI. We also seek to learn more about factors that can enhance or interfere with treatment, such as number of previous TBIs, presence of post-traumatic stress; and choice of in-person vs. video telemedicine delivery of care.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Researcher', 'fullName': 'Michelle Seewald', 'email': 'michelles33@gmail.com', 'orgName': 'VASDHC VMRF', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Elizabeth Twamley', 'email': 'etwamley@health.ucsd.edu', 'orgName': 'VASDHC VMRF', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Matthew Morgan', 'email': 'morgmr@gmail.com', 'orgName': 'VASDHC VMRF'}, {'role': 'Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Mark Ettenhofer', 'email': 'mark.l.ettenhofer.ctr@mail.mil', 'orgName': 'NMCSD DVBIC', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Researcher', 'fullName': 'Janae Wyckoff', 'email': 'jwyckoff@ucsd.edu', 'orgName': 'VASDHC VMRF', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'Naval Medical Center San Diego', 'address': '34800 Bob Wilson Dr', 'city': 'San Diego', 'state': 'CA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '+1-(619) 532-6400', 'isPrimary': False}, {'siteName': 'Veterans Medical Research Foundation', 'address': '3350 La Jolla Village Dr (151A) Building 13', 'city': 'San Diego', 'state': 'CA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '+1-(858) 642-3080', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD,[],[],['Clinical Assessment'],"Aim 1.

Public,409,Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) - Pediatric,FITBIR-STUDY0000409,Epidemiology,"Effective treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the greatest unmet needs in public health. Each year in the US, at least 1.7 million people suffer TBI; an estimated 3.2 to 5.3 million people live with the long-term physical, cognitive, and psychological health disabilities of TBI, with annual direct and indirect costs estimated at over $60 billion. The unique public-private partnership of investigators, philanthropy, and industry leaders brought together in the multicenter Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) proposal share a mission to accelerate clinical research in TBI. The goal is to create a large, high quality TBI database that integrates clinical, imaging, proteomic, genomic, and outcome biomarkers, and provides analytic tools and resources to establish more precise methods for TBI diagnosis and prognosis, improve outcome assessment, and compare the effectiveness and costs of tests, treatments, and services. The investigators hypothesize that this approach will permit better characterization and stratification of patients, allowing meaningful comparisons of treatments and outcomes, and thereby improving the next generation of clinical trials. Specific Aim 1. To create a widely accessible, comprehensive TBI Information Commons that integrates clinical, imaging, proteomic, genomic, and outcome biomarkers from subjects across the age and injury spectra, and provides analytic tools and resources to support TBI research. Specific Aim 2. To validate imaging, proteomic, and genetic biomarkers that will improve classification of TBI, permit appropriate choice and stratification of patients for clinical trials, and contribute to the development of a new taxonomy for TBI. Specific Aim 3. To evaluate a flexible outcome assessment battery comprised of a broad range of TBI common data elements that enables assessment of multiple outcome domains across all phases of recovery and at all levels of TBI severity. Specific Aim 4. To determine which tests, treatments, and services are effective and appropriate for which TBI patients, and use this evidence to recommend practices that offer the best value.

Public,412,Development of a Brief Version of Compensatory Cognitive Training for Veterans with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000412,Natural History,"Background:  Persistent and disabling cognitive difficulties are frequently reported by Veterans and ADSM with a history of mild TBI (mTBI), but interventions that are both accessible and effective remain limited. The proposed study will build on the existing literature, which supports the effectiveness of longer/more intensive cognitive rehabilitation (CR) interventions for Veterans/ADSM, by developing a non-invasive, inexpensive brief CR intervention that is specifically targeted to the unique needs of this population. Using an empirically validated 10-week CR intervention called Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) as the starting point, the proposed study aims to develop a brief CR intervention using a rigorous multi-faceted approach to identify the content for this intervention that will be specifically designed to address the needs and treatment goals of Veterans who have persisting cognitive difficulties secondary to mTBI. This intervention will address several current barriers to care including (1) reducing time and associated financial demands of a more extensive treatment, (2) offering strategies to improve day to day functioning that may lead to increased treatment compliance due to reductions in forgotten appointments and medications, and  (3) potentially increasing the ability to benefit from other treatments for common comorbid conditions by improving current cognitive functioning.
Objective/Hypothesis: The primary goal of this study is to develop the treatment manual for the proposed brief CR intervention, as well as other materials necessary to conduct the future RCT. In order to develop the manual, we propose to integrate information from multiple sources including  (1) a survey to assess treatment preferences, barriers to care, attitudes toward CR, and the nature/functional impact of ongoing cognitive difficulties and other symptoms among Veterans who were previously diagnosed with mTBI and endorsed persisting symptoms,(2) a survey of clinicians who currently provide CR interventions in VA settings, (3) review and comparison of findings from step 1 and 2 with the completed full-length CCT randomized controlled trial in Veterans with a history of mTBI, and (4) feedback from Veterans who participate in the newly developed brief CR intervention.
Impact and Military Relevance: Persisting cognitive difficulties are common among Veterans and ADSM with a history of mTBI and can have significant and wide range impact on day to day functioning. Empirically validated treatment options for CR exist for this population, but the length of treatment may pose a financial and time barrier. A brief CR intervention has the potential to significantly improve access to care for persisting cognitive difficulties among individuals with a history of mTBI and improve overall functioning and quality of life as well as serving as a possible gateway for engagement in other needed treatments.

Public,413,Human Head Impact Dose Concussion Risk Functions and Sensor-Based Military-Specific Environmental Monitoring System,FITBIR-STUDY0000413,Prospective,"Approximately 80% of military mTBI, affecting hundreds of thousands of soldiers, occur in non-deployed settings
like combative training activities.

Concussion and mTBI caused by loss of consciousness is
serious concern to the Departments of Defense and Transportation because it is a major impediment to egress in
aviation crashes.

Military, athletic and transportation authorities have long desired a system that can monitor
concussion and mTBI risk in real-time, as well as quantify head impacts that cause acute and long-term brain health
decline. In spite of recent proliferation in head impact instrumentation, there still is no objective means to identify
concussion risk in real-time from any single impact.

In this proposal we will use valid measurements to quantify head impact severity, clinical behavioral
assessments and brain damage locations in comprehensive studies of soldiers and athletes.

We specifically aim to
(1)Monitor dangerous head impacts to US Army Soldiers undergoing combative training without negatively
impacting concept of operations. Provide head injury risk functions and dose-response relationships gathered from
Modern Army Combatives Program (MACP) personnel,

(2) Develop a prototype military-specific boil-and-bite
Intelligent Mouthguard to instrument and monitor large numbers of personnel simultaneously without negatively
impacting the concept of operations,

(3) Conduct a pilot project to determine how to best monitor head impacts and
quantify injury risk in Federal Service Academy personnel participating in American Football, Ice Hockey,
Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer, Wrestling and Boxing,

(4) Conduct a pilot project to monitor head impacts in the airborne
environment and determine how to utilize this population to best quantify dose-response relationship without
negatively impacting concept of operations and

(5) Assist USAARL in laboratory testing to develop standard means
to quantify sensitivity and specificity of head impact dosimeters in ATD and PMHS tests.
After completing these projects, we will have defined the relationship(s) between head impact kinematics,
behavioral outcomes and likely locations of brain injury for US Military and athletic populations. We will be able to
define performance specifications for environmental sensing instruments that can monitor US Military members at
risk of short- and long-term head injury in training. We will know kinematic inputs responsible for highest head
injury risk and be able to pursue subsequent projects that design military, athletic and transportation-specific
protective systems to reduce impact kinematics in a physics-based manner. Finally, we will have pre-production,
ruggedized and user-friendly systems ready to monitor future US Military members.

Public,414,Photosensitivity and Pain in Complex Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000414,Epidemiology,"Chronic pain is a significant clinical problem, reported by about half of Veterans seeking care through the VA system.  Veterans that have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) are particularly likely to experience chronic pain.  The chronic pain experienced by these Veterans is also associated with marked fatigue and sleep difficulties, which can further diminish their psychological and physical function and well-being.
Acute pain can usually be controlled using pain-relieving drugs.  However, chronic pain can be extraordinarily difficult to treat, and cannot always be tied directly to activation of normal pain sensors in the body.  This pain is instead thought to be due to “sensitization” of pain-processing circuits in the spinal cord and brain.  In the sensitized state, pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord become abnormally responsive, and are activated by inputs that would not cause pain in most people.  As a result, everyday stimuli such as a gentle touch or normal light levels are experienced as painful.  The idea of sensitization is well supported by animal studies, where experimental techniques can be used to identify increased responsiveness of pain pathways in the brain.
Unfortunately, sensitization cannot be demonstrated so easily in humans.  Nevertheless, more than half of Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with TBI complain of abnormal sensitivity to light.  We believe that this heightened photosensitivity could be a window into pain in the brain.  This is based on our recent demonstration that a specific population of pain-enhancing brain cells can respond to light.  Because activation of these brain cells causes the pain threshold to be lowered, light could cause normal stimuli to be felt as painful.  Consistent with this idea, many chronic pain patients avoid bright light and complain that light is bothersome.  In addition, in some chronic pain patients, light can activate brain networks considered to signal pain.  Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that photosensitivity could be a useful marker for sensitization in Veterans with chronic pain and complex TBI.
Our overall hypothesis is that, due to aberrant engagement of pain-enhancing brain cells by light, Veterans with complex TBI will be more sensitive to light and experience more pain than non-trauma exposed Veterans.  Our objectives are to quantify photosensitivity in Veterans with complex TBI, and determine whether photosensitivity is associated with greater pain, poor sleep, and poor functional outcomes.  We will also use functional imaging to determine whether a dim light stimulus can activate the pain-related brain regions in Veterans who have suffered a TBI, but not in pain-free controls.  This would be strong evidence that pain pathways in the brain are sensitized after TBI.
If we are correct, photosensitivity could serve as a quantitative marker of sensitization in Veterans with complex TBI, guiding their treatment and serving as a measure of their responses to different therapies.  This work would also provide a better understanding of the brain mechanisms of pain in individual Veterans with chronic pain, giving us a simple, inexpensive test that could be applied in a standard clinical setting.  Because this test would provide us with a window into brain function, this could guide pharmacological treatments that act directly upon these brain mechanisms and reduce the need for unnecessary surgical procedures or chronic non-specific opioid use.  Finally, these studies could pave the way for modifying the light environment as a way to improve pain, functional outcomes, and quality of life for these Veterans.

Public,415,The Genetics and Epigenetics of Inflammation in Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000415,"Other, specify","	Inflammation has been implicated as an important player in both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TBI has been described as a risk factor for AD. Our group and others have described an inflammation related gene, TREM2 as an important player in AD pathology. Genetic variants in inflammation related genes, such as TREM2 and APOE, are strongly associated with AD suggesting the inflammation may be influenced at the DNA level. Our group has preliminary data that suggests that alteration of DNA by methylation of both APOE and TREM2 is associated with AD. Since methylation of DNA can change with exposure to brain injury and since methylation of DNA from blood may be an easily accessible biomarker of poor outcome after TBI, remaining critical questions include: Is TBI associated with altered methylation of inflammation related genes, such as TREM2 and APOE? Do active fighters have change in TREM2 methylation? For example, is there a methylation change present in fighter DNA when comparing the first visit to the second visit (after one year), or compared to age-matched controls? Is a methylation change in the active fighters also present in retired fighters and AD? Alternatively, since the retired fighters have a longer history of TBI, are their TREM2 methylation levels higher than active fighters? Or are high methylation levels in a different genetic location for active fighters compared to AD or retired fighters, such as in the TREM2 3’UTR compared to the promoter? Furthermore, is this epigenetic profile associated with specific genetic variants or traits, such as gene expression, biomarkers, hippocampal volume, or cognitive tests, that is similar to AD?

Public,416,High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Sensory Deficits in Complex TBI,FITBIR-STUDY0000416,Clinical Trial,"United States Veterans and Warfighters with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) sustained in recent conflicts frequently report sensory post-concussive symptoms (PCS) in multiple domains, despite near-normal visual and auditory acuity. These findings suggest that symptoms may arise not from a problem with unisensory perception but from impaired “top-down” processing of sensory information by a cognitive control network (CCN).
Prior work by our group in functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography (MEG) of mTBI confirms the existence of CCN dysfunction after mTBI and an association with post-concussive symptom scores. Unfortunately, no treatments for sensory PCS have been validated for military mTBI at this time. Vision therapy, a type of rehabilitation shown effective for post-concussive convergence insufficiency by our study team, involves significant time, expertise, and cumbersome equipment to deliver.
One promising intervention that can improve aberrant network activity is high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS). HD-tDCS is a well-tolerated, non-invasive brain stimulation technique that utilizes focused electrical fields applied through the scalp to
modulate neuroplasticity. When paired with rehabilitation tasks, HD-tDCS can increase functional gains beyond what is obtained from a task alone. Our study team has shown efficacy of HD-tDCS for post-stroke aphasia, and is currently conducting a trial of conventional tDCS for cognitive PCS in civilians. To date, HD-tDCS has never been studied in military mTBI and represents a highly innovative treatment approach.
The NAVIGATe Study is a randomized, sham-controlled trial of HD-tDCS paired with training tasks for the treatment of sensory PCS. Eighty Veterans and Active Duty Service members with mTBI will be recruited from the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Health Care System (NMVAHCS) Polytrauma Support Clinic and the 377th Medical Group at Kirtland Air Force Base for the stimulation arm of the protocol. They will undergo MEG combined with structural MRI to perform magnetic source imaging (MSI) and functional MRI to characterize the temporal and spatial characteristics of involved brain networks, along with sensory and cognitive batteries.
They will then undergo 10 daily sessions of sensory training combined with active or sham HD-tDCS delivered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a key node in the CCN. Sensory training consists of vision therapy administered through a virtual reality headset equipped with eye-tracking capability, and a dual auditory/visual working memory task validated by our study team in numerous protocols. Each session will last for 30 minutes.
Following the 10th stimulation session, the cognitive and sensory batteries will be repeated, along with MSI. Long-term improvements in quality of life will be assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after stimulation. The primary outcome variable is change in the somatic symptom subscale of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, a measure of PCS. In addition to active versus sham comparisons of HD-tDCS effect, a group of 40 healthy subjects will be enrolled to serve as imaging-only controls to evaluate natural variations in brain and behavior in the absence of stimulation.

Public,417,Implemention Fidelity and Benefits of the Critical Care Pediatric Guideline Adherence and Outcomes Program in Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000417,Clinical Trial,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a public health crisis for children in the US and worldwide.There are no proven therapies to treat TBI, and evidenced-based guidelines have been developed over the past 2 decades to guide best current practices. Yet, implementation strategies are lacking. In prior work, we found that adherence to the TBI guidelines was associated with 6% better outcomes in 5 leading U.S. academic centers. However, TBI
guideline adherence remains low and the guidelines have limitations related to recommendation applicability across health care systems and across countries. In response, we developed and pilot tested an innovative multilevel Pediatric Guideline Adherence and Outcomes (PEGASUS) program to increase TBI guideline adherence.

This has not been supported by recent PET imaging studies including our previous work in Vietnam War veterans.  PET scanning to measure the proteins Amyloid and Tau are the key predictors of future AD. It is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD. However, PET TBI studies have had small cohorts and have not used the latest generation of more sensitive imaging biomarkers.
Hypothesis: That individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a higher prevalence of AD related pathology and neurodegeneration compared to age matched controls.
Study Design: We will use the latest generation of PET imaging and 7 Tesla MRI to measure AD pathology. We will study 150 elderly TBI subjects and 100 age-matched controls.  In addition, psychological testing will be carried out such that the imaging results can be tested for correlation with clinical endpoints

This study will examine the neurobiological, cognitive, and psychological effects of repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (rMTBIs) in women who are subjected to intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is violence perpetrated by a current or former spouse, partner, significant other, boyfriend, or girlfriend, and it is the most common form of violence against women. Globally, nearly 1 in 3 women over the age of 15 have experienced IPV, and several reports have shown that women subjected to IPV experience rMTBIs at alarmingly high rates. In one sample of 99 women, approximately half indicated a history of repetitive IPV-related TBIs, and these injuries were related to measures of both cognition and psychological health. It is believed by many, that the sequelae of these rMTBIs (e.g., cognitive difficulties) likely contribute to the challenges women experience in trying to escape an already complex and dangerous abusive situation. IPV-related rMTBI is a critical but unappreciated public health epidemic. Although there have been a number of calls for research on this topic, very few studies exist. Only our two published studies have used neuroimaging to examine the association between rMTBIs and markers of neurotrauma in women who have experienced IPV. Therefore, in a sample of women who have previously sustained IPV, we will collect resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI data to assess functional and microstructural connectivity abnormalities, as well as magnetic resonance spectroscopy data and blood samples to test for altered levels of relevant neurometabolites and proteins. We will also collect cognitive, psychological, and post-concussion symptom measures to relate to these neurobiological measures. A better understanding of rMTBIs and their association with neurobiological abnormalities, cognition, and psychological health in women subjected to IPV will enable more efficacious care and treatment, and ultimately improve health outcomes for this highly underserved and often misunderstood population.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Eve M Valera, PhD', 'email': 'eve_valera@hms.harvard.edu', 'orgName': 'Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Annie-Lori Joseph', 'email': 'ajoseph24@mgh.harvard.edu', 'orgName': 'MGH'}, {'role': 'Researcher', 'fullName': 'Larisa Shrestha', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'lshrestha2@mgh.harvard.edu', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Courtney Gibeley', 'email': 'cgibeley@mgh.harvard.edu', 'orgName': 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'address': '149 13th Street ', 'city': 'Charlestown', 'state': 'MA', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '6177264962', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],['5R01NS112694-02'],NIH-NINDS,[],[],['Clinical Assessment'],,2020-08-25,2023-07-31,144.0,,

Public,423,Evaluation of the impact of cerebral contusions on brain network dysfunction and epileptogenesis among patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000423,Prospective; Retrospective,"In the general population, posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) accounts for 5% of all epilepsy cases and 20% of symptomatic epilepsy. This number is understandably higher in the military population where almost 50% of TBI victims, who sustain penetrating head injuries. PTE has a unique feature in which seizures begin late after TBI. In approximately 80% of cases, epilepsy develops within 2 years, but the risk can extend for over 10 years post TBI. This project will study how PTE develops, which will reveal a new understanding of the brain network abnormalities associated with PTE. It will contribute new knowledges on the mechanism of PTE development from the perspective of brain network dysfunction. Although, studies have identified risk factors associated with PTE, which include but not limited to severity of initial TBI, length of posttraumatic amnesia, presence of intracranial hemorrhage, penetrating head injuries, depressed skull fractures, retention of metal fragments, location of lesion(s), cerebral contusions, age, and comorbid chronic alcoholism, none of these studies have identified any biomarkers that can reliably predict the development of PTE in TBI patients. This is partially because the mechanism of PTE development is not well understood, which makes the prevention and treatment of PTE challenging. Recent discoveries have suggested that epilepsy is a disease of brain network that facilitate the spreading and sustaining of seizures.Advanced Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) offer noninvasive means to study the changes of brain network architecture associated PTE. DTI measures structural connectivity relating to white matter tracks in the brain, whereas rsfMRI infers functional connectivity by measuring the correlation of the blood flow patterns between two brain regions. By using these two MRI techniques, this research will reveal the abnormalities of structural and functional brain connectivity in PTE patients. We will then obtain the brain connectivity network parameters in TBI patients to study the evolution of these the connectivity during the recovery phase of TBI. Later, we will compare the different of these parameters between the group who develops PTE and the group who does not.

Approximately 33% of women exposed to IPV report physical trauma resulting in heighted risk of head injury in this population. Recent work suggests that anywhere from 40-90% of women experience head trauma due to IPV. IPV-related head trauma is caused by blunt force trauma, being pushed or violently shaken, and/or strangulation, which can result in focal trauma or contusions, acceleration and deceleration injuries, as well as hypoxia and anoxia due to strangulation, respectively. Limited research has shown that women exposed to IPV with head trauma report higher depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology, as well as impaired cognitive function relative to women with IPV and no exposure to head trauma. Although the clinical features of repeated exposure to head trauma identified in IPV are similar to the effects observed in military traumatic brain injury (TBI) and sports-related concussion, limited work has been done to understand IPV-related head trauma, in particular its chronic cognitive and psychological effects as well as associated brain changes. Through a multi-site research collaboration consisting of members of the Enhancing NeuroImaging and Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) IPV Working Group, the proposed study will characterize the cognitive, psychological, and neural profiles of IPV-related head trauma. Semi-structured interviews will be used to obtain IPV specific information such as abuse and head trauma history and frequency. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery will be used to determine cognitive and psychological status, while sophisticated neuroimaging techniques will be used to characterize neural structure, function, and brain metabolites in IPV with exposure to head trauma relative to IPV without exposure to head trauma.

As many as 5,400 of these personnel experience complex mTBI involving vestibular, cognitive, somatosensory, and/or autonomic dysregulation. If untreated, complex mTBI can result in chronic symptoms/impairment, and limited operational capabilities and duty restrictions (Belanger et al., 2011; Kontos et al., 2013). Interventions that target the involved domains in complex mTBI can improve symptoms, reduce impairment, and accelerate return to activity or duty (RTA/D) (Kontos et al., 2018).

Public,427,Intracranial Pressure Assessment and Screening System (IPASS): A Portable Device for Non-Invasive Monitoring of Intracranial Pressure (ICP) in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI),FITBIR-STUDY0000427,Prospective,"The military needed a way for medics to measure intracranial pressure (ICP) non-invasively in the field. Vivonics' portable, non-invasive ICP monitor enables medics to measure ICP instantly in any battlefield condition. The
IPASS is a noninvasive device for continuous assessment of intracranial pressure (ICP).  ICP increases after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to a blow to the head or as a result of other medical conditions that impact the brain.  In current practice, ICP is only continuously monitored by invasive devices requiring surgical installation. Vivonics is currently developing IPASS (Intracranial Pressure Assessment and Screening System) to provide a low-cost solution to quickly and easily assess ICP and continue to monitor for changes, allowing the physician to determine appropriate patient care.

ICP is a key parameter in the management of TBI because damage to the small structures within a brain causes local swelling, and even mild swelling in the fixed volume of the skull results in increased pressure.  According to the CDC, in 2014, there were approximately 2.53 million TBI-related emergency room visits, and 288,000 TBI-related hospitalizations.  In addition, there are many more injured, especially in an active population such as athletes or in the military, who often shrug off the seemingly mild symptoms of headache, dizziness, and the like, but experience clinically significant elevated intracranial pressure.

Elevated intracranial pressure, whether from TBI, stroke, hydrocephalus or other medical conditions, is itself a medical issue that must be promptly treated.  Such elevated pressure can cause brain cell damage, leading to a negative spiral that ends in permanent brain injury or death.

IPASS addresses the needs of the market by providing important ICP information in a completely noninvasive way, enabling testing in the emergency room and outside the hospital. The device consists of a handheld electronic readout unit and sets of disposable sensors, placed on a patient’s forehead, ear, and finger. The standard methods to record intracranial pressure require access through the skull, which requires highly trained personnel in a surgical facility, is costly, and has its own associated risks.  Imaging methods that can observe the structures of the brain for evidence of swelling are large and power hungry, and moreover cannot identify elevated pressure in cases where the brain structures have had time to accommodate for the increase.",Not Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Claudia Roberts', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Baylor College of Medicine', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Other', 'fullName': 'Abbie Ransdell', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Vivonics', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Rachel Peterson', 'email': 'rpeterson@vivonics.com', 'orgName': 'Vivonics'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Michele Pierro', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Vivonics', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'University of Maryland', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}, {'siteName': 'Vivonics', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}, {'siteName': 'Baylor College of Medicine', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}]",[],[],DoD,['TBI'],[],[],Collect Pilot human clinical data (including systemic parameters) from TBI patients with an External Ventricular Drain (EVD) for side by side assessment (N=30),2021-11-01,2023-01-01,30.0,,2705720.0

Public,429,Improving Neurotrauma by Depolarization Inhibition with Combination Therapy (INDICT):  a Phase 2 Randomized Trial,FITBIR-STUDY0000429,Clinical Trial,"Spreading depolarizations (SD) are a cytotoxic dysfunction of cerebral gray matter and a dominant pathophysiologic process in peri-lesion cortex of many severe TBI patients who undergo emergency surgery. We hypothesize that intensive care management of patients based on the occurrence of SDs, as measured by electrocorticography (ECoG), may reduce secondary injury and improve outcomes. We will conduct a randomized Phase 2 feasibility trial that uses real-time SD monitoring to guide implementation of a tier-based protocol of intensive care therapies aimed at SD suppression. The specific aims are to: (1) determine the feasibility of real-time SD monitoring to guide intensive care management of severe TBI, and (2) determine the effect of SD-guided vs. standard care management to reduce secondary brain insults in severe TBI. We aim to enroll approximately 72 patients who require neurological surgery for emergency treatment of TBI at 3 study sites. ECoG data will be monitored continuously in real-time for the occurrence of SDs during intensive care. When SDs are observed, these patients will be randomized 1:1 to either standard (control) or SD-guided care. In the standard care arm, treatment will follow local and national guidelines with blinding to further ECoG results. In the SD-guided arm, treatment will follow a tiered-based protocol with escalation and de-escalation based on efficacy to suppress further SD pathology. Treatments will include use of ketamine sedation and adjusted targets for plasma glucose, cerebral perfusion pressure, temperature, and PaCO2. For Aim 1, we will assess the accuracy of real-time SD scoring and compliance with protocol tier assignment and therapy implementation. For Aim 2, we will compare the burden of SD pathology, other measures of cerebral physiology (intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures, and brain oxygenation), and medical complications between the two study arms. We expect to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted, personalized treatment of a neuronal mechanism of secondary injury based on real-time measurements. The efficacy of specific therapies to suppress SDs may inform neurocritical care guidelines and generalize to application in more widespread patient groups.

Public,430,Teaching Self-Management Skills to Improve Self-Efficacy and Quality of Life for Caregiver Dyads in TBI and Dementia Populations,FITBIR-STUDY0000430,Clinical Trial,"Approximately 5.3 million people (2% of the U.S. population) live with a long-term disability as a result of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and between 5-8% of those older than 60 suffer from Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. Further, a history of TBI has been reported to increase the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. Not only is there a suggested pathobiological linkage between TBI and dementia, but these populations endure many of the same cognitive, behavioral, and emotional symptoms. Without the proper skills to manage stress and to regulate emotion associated with these sequelae, overall quality of life (QOL) is negatively impacted for both patients and their caregivers. Standard, communitybased interventions primarily provide support and psychoeducation services. This approach may help people in the moment, but it does not provide lasting skills to manage stress beyond the treatment contact. It is thus imperative to teach patients and their caregivers to manage their physical and psychological health, foster self-efficacy, and improve overall QOL. This goal becomes even more critical when considering the growing evidence that exposure to even a mild TBI may increase risk for dementia, forcing individuals to potentially confront the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional challenges of post-injury again later in life.

The proposed randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of WeCAN (Wellness, Coping, and Adaptation for Neurologic Conditions), an innovative group treatment for caregiver dyads in neurologic populations. WeCAN is a twelve-session treatment that teaches self-management skills of coping, stress management and problem solving. WeCAN will be evaluated in three populations: chronic mild TBI, moderate to severe TBI, and in dementia. This approach will enable us to establish the treatment’s utility in all severities of TBI, and to substantiate that skills learned would equally benefit a dementia population. Kessler Foundation will serve as the Coordinating Center (PI, Denise Krch, PhD), and will enroll individuals with moderate to severe TBI. Franciscan Health (Site PI, Summer Ibarra, PhD) and University of Michigan (Site PI, Benjamin Hampstead, PhD) will serve as Partnering Sites, and will enroll individuals with chronic mild TBI and mixed dementia, respectively. Each Site serves as complementary partners, supported by respective expertise/ resources in their clinical populations, in a unified research initiative to improve QOL.

A total of 180 patient caregiver dyads (60 chronic mild TBI, 60 moderate to severe TBI, 60 mixed dementia) will be randomized to either the WeCAN treatment group or an Active Peer Support Control. Both groups will undergo one 2-hour session/week for 12 weeks. Participants will be evaluated on outcome measures at baseline, post-treatment and at 6-months post-treatment.


It is expected that the findings from this project will determine WeCAN’s efficacy in improving self-efficacy and QOL for individuals with chronic mild, moderate and severe TBI and dementia and their caregivers. The proposed randomized controlled trial takes an expanded approach and treats both the patient and the caregiver, differentiating itself from the vast majority of existing studies. Additionally, the establishment of biomarkers as they relate to the potential for a WeCAN treatment effect in these populations is paramount to the goal of delivering efficacious patient-centered care. Overall, these methodologic elements will allow us to go beyond determining the efficacy of the study; it will provide insight into moderating factors and other predictors of treatment efficacy for both patients and caregivers. Thus, our innovation in treatment design challenges current paradigms and has the potential to advance the field of rehabilitation in TBI and dementia.",Not Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Denise Krch', 'email': 'dkrch@kesslerfoundation.org', 'orgName': 'Kessler Foundation'}, {'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Denise Krch', 'email': '', 'orgName': 'Kessler Foundation', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'Franciscan Health', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}, {'siteName': 'University of Michigan', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': False}, {'siteName': 'Kessler Foundation', 'address': '', 'city': '', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],[],DoD,"['mildTBI', 'Dementia', 'modTBI', ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'severeTBI']",[],[],"We propose the following harmonized aims:

Public,433,Transforming Research And Clinical Knowledge in Geriatric Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-GERI),FITBIR-STUDY0000433,Epidemiology,"Some 2.8 million Americans seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI) annually, resulting in
estimated annual costs of over $75 billion. Older adults have the highest and fastest rising rate of TBI of any
other age-group, with 1 in 50 adults age ≥75y seeking medical attention for TBI in 2013. Older adults with TBI
experience higher mortality, slower recovery, worse outcomes, and may be at especially high risk for post-TBI
dementia. There are few evidence-based guidelines for management, no tools to provide patients and families
with reliable estimates of prognosis, and few proven treatments. Progress has been limited by: 1. systematic
exclusion of older disabled patients from most prior prospective TBI studies, and 2. lack of age-appropriate TBI
research tools. The overall objective is to launch a 2-site prospective geriatric TBI cohort study that will directly
address these barriers by applying state-of-the-art geriatric research methods to the field of TBI to improve
representation of older patients in TBI research, and to develop a novel approach to measuring age appropriate
TBI predictors, outcomes, blood-based biomarkers, and neuropathology. The approach rests on 2
foundational concepts: 1. Geriatric TBI is different from TBI in younger patients and will require a targeted age appropriate
approach. 2. Baseline health status – including comorbidities/polypharmacy, physical frailty,
functional status, and brain structure – is recognized as a key predictor of outcome in the field of geriatrics but
is not systematically measured in TBI research. The central hypothesis is that pre-injury health will be
extremely heterogeneous in geriatric TBI and will be a key predictor of outcome in this population. An

Public,436,A Highly Portable Device for Assessment of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Deployed and Far-Forward Settings,FITBIR-STUDY0000436,Prospective,"Background: The problem addressed with this proposal is the need for an objective diagnosis of mTBI in the constraints of a far-forward environment. Oculogica has developed technology that has been FDA cleared to make an objective diagnosis of concussion (EBC). The purpose of this project is to take this technology and modify the test and put it in a form factor that is appropriate for the far-forward environment from a test setup, test duration, and hardware size, weight, durability, and power perspective, without losing diagnostic performance.

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop the EyeBOX Lens (EBLens): a fast, non-invasive, high performing, wearable, ultra-low power, diagnostic for mTBI, in deployed field and far-forward settings. The EBLens will diagnose initial concussion/mTBI. In addition, the EBLens will assess recovery.

Hypothesis: The EBLens will have at least 70% sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of acute concussion, and for recovery determination for return to activity and duty (RTA).

Study Design: Once the EBLens is prototyped, an algorithm for diagnosing concussion will be developed that is specifically appropriate for the EBLens via a clinical study comparing concussed to non-concussed subjects. This algorithm and the EBLens will be validated in a subsequent, validation study designed for FDA submission. The correlation of the EBLens output with resolution of symptoms will also be observed in longitudinal follow-up of concussed subjects in the validation study.

Impact and Translation: The fast test (under a minute), ultra-low power requirement and small, wearable, form factor of the EBLens are fundamental innovations, enabling unprecedented objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury in a far-forward setting.

Public,437,CARE4Kids,FITBIR-STUDY0000437,Epidemiology; Natural History; Observational; Prospective,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Research Project Concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of acquired brain injury in children and adolescents. While the majority of youth with concussion recover within 2-4 weeks, a substantial subset (15-30%) take longer to recover and develop persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS). This group experiences worse function, more pain and seeks a greater amount of medical assessments and treatments. Prolonged impairments in early and middle adolescents (EMA) can result in changes in developmental trajectory and long-term disability. There is no single agreed upon definition for PPCS and predictive algorithms are largely based on nonspecific subjective clinical symptoms. Furthermore, there are currently no good preventive strategies or targeted treatments. It is a major public health challenge to develop objective biological markers that better predict PPCS, which will provide the opportunity for improved prognostication, potential preventive interventions and new therapeutics based on underlying biological mechanisms. It is the central goal of this CARE4Kids Center Without Walls to discover objective autonomic, imaging and blood-based biomarkers that, when integrated with neuropsychological and neurological signs and symptoms, will optimally predict PPCS in EMA. Once identified, these biomarkers and clinical measures will then be validated in a more generalized group and developed into an improved predictive algorithm for PPCS. The linkage of objective biological measures to different clinical phenotypes (termed endophenotypes in this application) will provide a mechanistic understanding of different types of PPCS. It is hypothesized that endophenotypes may share pathobiology with migraine, dysautonomia, anxiety, depression or other symptoms commonly seen in those with PPCS.

Public,445,Development and Clinical Validation of Noninvasive Diagnostics for Mitochondrial Disease,FITBIR-STUDY0000445,Prospective,"Concussion and primary mitochondrial disease (PMD), both conditions with substantial public health burden and long-term consequences for youth and young adults, are conditions of bioenergetic dysfunction. Our primary challenge is the lack of clinically feasible physiological tests of bioenergetics to diagnose these deficits and monitor them over time for PMD and through recovery for concussion. In addition, the lack of objective assessments prevents the development of effective concussion treatment strategies as clear therapeutic targets remain ill-defined. Further elucidating the link between bioenergetics and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function provides an opportunity to address this challenge; ANS dysfunction in these conditions represents a rational target for assessment via clinically feasible approaches including pupillometry, exercise testing, and cerebral oxygenation measurement via functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The metabolic mismatch that occurs after concussion is fundamentally a mitochondrial bioenergetic problem with characteristics similar to PMD. Investigating the nature and time course of bioenergetic dysfunction across clinical conditions, from both the perspective of a common injury, where deficits develop and recover, as well as an inborn genetic disorder, as in PMD, where the bioenergetic state is more fixed, provides a robust means to enhance our understanding of these mechanisms and their physiological manifestations. ANS dysfunction can be quantified using pupillometry, exercise testing and cerebral oxygenation determination using fNIRS, which represent objective measures that a) are clinically feasible with great diagnostic and prognostic potential, as well as b) serve as methods for monitoring treatment and determining physiological recovery. We will be the first to examine the utility of multi-modal clinical translational technology for the detection of ANS dysfunction in the diagnosis, prognosis and determination of recovery after concussion and the clinical relevance of these measures to PMD. We capitalize on advanced technology in fNIRS and pupillometry, as well as the simplicity of an exercise step test, to quantify specific physiological ANS deficits and provide insight into the underlying metabolic mitochondrial pathologies. This innovative approach will provide the most robust, comprehensive, multi-dimensional phenotypic characterization of ANS function in concussion to date and accelerate the identification of targets for treatment of both concussion and PMD. Furthering our understanding of the bioenergetic dysfunction underlying both concussion and PMD has the potential to have far-reaching impact on military health. As a signature injury of modern warfare, concussion is a condition which, among military personnel, is essential to identify early with accurate and objective diagnostics in order to implement timely removal from the far-forward setting to prevent further secondary injury. Having quantitative measures that prognose recovery is critical to identify those who need removal from the active front to a medical setting for further testing and treatment and those who can remain awaiting rapid recovery. This study will advance our ability to use measures of the ANS for these purposes, as well as an objective means of determining readiness to return to duty safely. Looking beyond concussion, understanding the ANS manifestations of PMD will further the identification of rational treatments for other conditions with mitochondrial dysfunction and may provide insight into potential performance enhancing measures for other end organs such as skeletal muscle where mitochondrial function is critical. Clinical trials to study such treatments using these quantitative outcome measures would result in advances that could have important implications for endurance among military servicemen and women and would represent a potential paradigm shift in terms of improving performance.

Public,446,A Prospective Observational Study on Therapeutic and Adverse Effects of Medical Cannabis for Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury,FITBIR-STUDY0000446,Observational,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a large public health burden for civilians, service members and Veterans. Particularly concerning are the chronic symptoms of TBI, which include emotional problems (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder), physical problems (sleep and pain), and problems with cognitive functioning. These problems prevent most TBI survivors from returning to a normal life with their families and at work. Currently there are very few treatments for the chronic symptoms of TBI. As a result, a growing number of medical providers and patients are considering medical cannabis (MC) to treat chronic symptoms related to TBI. MC is now legal in New Mexico as well as 32 additional US states. Our and other’s research suggest that cannabis use may be 4-9 times higher in younger Veterans with a history of trauma relative to the general population. Although there is anecdotal evidence that MC is effective for treating emotional problems as well as pain and sleep disorders, recent systematic reviews have concluded that the actual scientific evidence for MC has not been established. This is primarily because it is illegal to do studies to examine the effects of cannabis on health-related disorders in a careful and controlled fashion. While there are certain ways to do this research with federal funding (using cannabis strains from the government), this type of research has very low validity and does not generalize to the types of cannabis products that are regularly used in state-regulated markets. Moreover, TBI results in complex pathophysiological processes that involve slow but steady changes to brain function, brain vasculature, and the structure of the brain. These processes have been shown to go on for many years post-injury. Therefore, even if cannabis products were relatively safe for healthy individuals to consume, it does not mean that they would be safe for TBI survivors to consume. The primary objectives of the current study are therefore to determine if MC has potential therapeutic or adverse effects on TBI-related symptoms (emotional, physical and cognitive) as well as overall brain health. Symptoms are measured using standard clinical tests, whereas brain health is measured using advanced brain scans and blood-based biomarkers. Based on our preliminary data in chronic TBI survivors, we predict that TBI will not have any therapeutic effects on emotional or physical symptoms, and will have detrimental effects on cognition and overall brain health. Regardless of a positive or a negative outcome, the current study will help Veterans with chronic TBI symptoms who are considering the use of MC to treat their symptoms. It will also inform doctors, clinicians and other researchers about the potential therapeutic and adverse effects of MC on TBI pathophysiology.",Recruiting,"[{'role': 'Primary Principal Investigator', 'fullName': 'Andrew R Mayer', 'email': 'amayer@mrn.org', 'orgName': 'The Mind Research Network', 'orcId': ''}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Andrew Dodd', 'email': 'adodd@mrn.org', 'orgName': 'The Mind Research Network'}, {'role': 'Data Manager', 'fullName': 'Tracey Wick', 'email': 'twick@mrn.org', 'orgName': 'The Mind Research Network', 'orcId': ''}]","[{'siteName': 'The Mind Research Network', 'address': '1101 Yale Blvd. NE', 'city': 'Albuquerque', 'state': 'NM', 'country': 'United States of America', 'phoneNumber': '', 'isPrimary': True}]",[],['W81XWH-22-1-1054'],DoD,[],[],['Imaging'],"Specific Aim 1: Quantify chronic emotional, physical and cognitive symptoms post-TBI relative to healthy controls (HC), and how chronic symptoms, neural and vascular functioning are affected by medical cannabis (MC) use relative to standard therapies (ST).

Public,448,Novel Intervention for Chronic Complex TBI in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans,FITBIR-STUDY0000448,Clinical Trial,"Background:  There is currently no FDA-approved medication for the treatment of TBI.  Safe and efficacious pharmacological interventions for chronic TBI in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans are urgently needed. Converging biomarker and clinical data strongly support a neurosteroid therapeutic (pregnenolone) as an efficacious new treatment for TBI that is safe and disease-modifying, and also has tremendous potential to be utilized in longer acting formulations (intramuscular, patch, etc) to enhance adherence and accessibility to this intervention.

This neurosteroid has been exceptionally well-tolerated in our recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  For example, OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with low back pain demonstrated significant improvements after 4 weeks of treatment with pregnenolone at 500 mg per day with minimal reported side effects (Naylor et al 2020). We have also conducted pilot (Marx et al 2016) and proof-of-concept investigations (in preparation; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01336413) at this 500 mg dose in which pregnenolone was similarly well-tolerated, with a side effect profile comparable to placebo and no serious adverse events to date (Marx et al 2009, 2014, 2016; Naylor et al 2020; others recently completed).  Pregnenolone also significantly improved irritability, concentration, sleep, and other behavioral symptoms in TBI, and improved functional outcome in two studies of psychosis.  We have also shown consistent downstream metabolism to allopregnanolone in our studies following both acute and chronic pregnenolone treatment, increasing this regenerative and neuroprotective neurosteroid 10-fold or more – supporting pregnenolone treatment as a precursor loading strategy to enhance downstream allopregnanolone.

In addition to these strong supportive clinical data, we have extensive biomarker findings in two independent cohorts showing that neurosteroids are significantly decreased in patients with a history of TBI. Ameliorating neurosteroid deficits could thus be clinically therapeutic and address an underlying pathophysiology of TBI symptoms and frequently co-occurring conditions such as PTSD, depression, and pain.

Objective:  We propose to conduct a Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to determine the maximal well-tolerated dose of a promising neurosteroid intervention for the treatment of chronic TBI and frequently co-occurring conditions such as depression, PTSD, and pain. In addition, we will investigate biomarker candidates of therapeutic response, including neurosteroid quantifications by mass spectrometry, immune and autoimmune markers, neurodegenerative markers, and markers relevant to cardiovascular health.

Specific Aims and Study Design:
1.  To conduct an RCT with a novel neurosteroid intervention (pregnenolone) to maximally well-tolerated dosing in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with a history of chronic TBI (54 participants/group, 108 total) to determine if pregnenolone improves psychological health (primary endpoint, BSI), and also functional outcome (SF-36), cognition (WAIS-IV, Stroop), PTSD symptoms (PCL5), depression symptoms (BDI-II), and pain symptoms (BPI) [secondary endpoints] compared to placebo.
2.  To identify biomarker predictors of therapeutic response, including neurosteroid levels by mass spectrometry (attomolar sensitivity), inflammatory markers, neurodegenerative analytes, and markers of cardiovascular health.

Impact and Relevance to Military Health:  Both Veterans and military personnel (as well as the general public) with history of TBI are expected to benefit from this research.  Near-term impact: The proposed RCT could provide critical evidence to identify pregnenolone as a safe, well-tolerated, efficacious treatment for TBI sequelae.  Long-term impact: These studies could translate rapidly to efficacious new therapeutic interventions, leading to pivotal Phase III studies and FDA approval at an accelerated timeframe.

Measures developed in the Assessment of Military Multitasking Performance (AMMP) study show promise for identifying subtle movement and cognitive impairments following concussion, but the clinical feasibility of AMMP items is limited. One component of AMMP is under study in a 2-year project (POWARTOTAL) at UNC-CH Ft Bragg and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, gathering movement
nformation via phone accelerometry/gyroscopes, providing real time feedback to
clinicians using the tactical movement test with their patients post-concussion. CAMP will incorporate the existing POWAR-TOTAL test and add 2 modified AMMP tasks (an exertion task with a physical load, and a dual-task agility measure), sensitive physiologic measures (reaction time and heart rate variability) and post-exertion testing. The CAMP test battery challenges physical, physiologic and cognitive performance and increases the
range and objectivity of test components for use post-concussion.
Objective: The objective of this project is to validate the CAMP test battery that
integrates 3 physical tasks and post-exertion measures with sensitive movement and physiologic metrics.
Study Design: This observational study will evaluate the CAMP test battery that can be administered with the use of inexpensive equipment in typical clinical space; conduct known group analyses of the components of the test battery; and examine the ability to predict return to duty status following rehabilitation post-concussion using CAMP parameters (with logistic regression). The resulting CAMP test application will incorporate algorithms that provide feedback regarding movement characteristics, heart
rate variability and reaction time in real time, providing comparison values from healthy controls to increase interpretability for the clinician and patient. Plans for dissemination will be developed and implemented with DVBIC and military stakeholders.
Impact/Military Benefit: CAMP is designed to fill an existing gap in the rehabilitation assessment arena with military relevant tasks that approximate the physical and cognitive demands of active duty training.

Public,454,Military Injuries Understanding post-Traumatic Epilepsy: Bioinformatics with big data to examine multi-modal PTE biomarkers,FITBIR-STUDY0000454,Observational,"Objective: Several inter-related pathomechanisms are responsible for seizure progression following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), which can involve TBI gliosis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, inflammation, loss of neurons and glia, axonal and dendritic plasticity. The extent to which these heterogenous pathological changes are epileptogenic, or simply related to the brain injury is poorly understood. Recent advances in longitudinal analysis, methods for longitudinal patient experience data, neuroimaging, and biomarker analyses for epileptogenesis have yet to be combined, but together, could provide a means to accurately map the causative links between TBI and epilepsy, and help predict who will have treatment resistant epilepsy and better/worse health trajectories. We propose to integrate multimodal imaging, clinical, experience, and biomarker data within a longitudinal study of patient outcomes. We will gather and analyze data from Veterans with epilepsy and match psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [PNES] and no seizure controls on TBI status in order to construct and evaluate a predictive model of the emergence and outcomes of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE).

Research Design: This multimodal perspective on Veteran’s health offers opportunities for biomarkers and imaging measures to mutually enhance each other’s diagnostic precision and trajectory prediction. Using these diverse data and bioinformatics tools, we can better inform the development of personalized treatment approaches to decrease PTE risk among Veterans and reduce morbidity. Our overarching hypotheses are that 1) there will be trajectories of health for Veterans with epilepsy phenotypes (PTE, non-traumatic epilepsy [NTE], treatment resistant epilepsy [TRE]) that can be distinguished from matched Veterans with PNES and no seizure controls (NSC; no epilepsy/PNES); 2) trajectories will be associated with change in blood-based biomarkers, neuroimaging findings, and baseline to chronic assessments; and 3) biomarker/neuroimaging findings will vary by epilepsy phenotype  and will differ from matched Veterans with PNES and NSC).

Methodology: This prospective study will use machine learning methods on diverse data to identify health trajectories and correlates associated with epilepsy phenotypes (PTE, NTE, TRE). We will conduct a prospective study with a longitudinal cohort developed over the course of an existing PTE study. We will recruit individuals who previously agreed to be re-contacted for future research, and individuals with definite and probable PNES from another ongoing Epilepsy Research Program funded study. First, we will invite individuals with PTE and NTE. Once individuals agree to participate and take a short survey, we will identify matched controls (age, sex, TBI) from the same survey respondent pool, and matched PNES cases from the PNES cohort. We will invite 50 Veterans from each of the following six groups (PTE, NTE, PNES+TBI, PNES-no TBI, NSC+TBI, NSC-no TBI) to VA Salt Lake City to undergo clinical evaluation (epilepsy only), neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and blood draw for biomarker analysis. We will also obtain pre-deployment serum samples for those individuals from the DoD serum repository. We will use recurrent neural network analyses to develop health trajectories, and multivariate regression on integrated data from the three studies to identify the features most strongly correlated with PTE and persistent seizure outcomes.

Aim 1 will develop longitudinal trajectories for Veterans with epilepsy (including PTE and pharmacological treatment-resistant epilepsy [TRE]) compared to matched Veterans with PNES, and no seizure controls (NSC; no epilepsy or PNES). We will incorporate historical comorbidity and treatment patterns, data from surveys, and ecological momentary assessment (EMA; see A.2.3) within a recursive neural network (RNN) to model and explain the temporal signatures of diverging PTE/health trajectories. In Aim 2, we will compare measures of neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments across individuals with epilepsy and matched PNES and non-seizure controls with an ensemble of regression models. Aim 3 will compare brain-based biomarkers (DoD serum repository for pre-deployment samples and current samples) among epilepsy, PNES and NSC groups to determine changes relating PTE and TRE development. Aim 4 will explore relationships between the informative biomarkers, imaging/physiologic measures, psychometrics, and survey responses identified in Aims 1-3 using machine learning approaches designed for use with multimodal sequential data.
